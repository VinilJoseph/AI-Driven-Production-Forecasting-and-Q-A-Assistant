Date: February 2007 Preface The advances in the digital computing technology in the last decade have revolutionized the petroleum industry. Using the modern computer technologies, today’s petro- leum production engineers work much more efficiently than ever before in their daily activities, including analyz- ing and optimizing the performance of their existing pro- duction systems and designing new production systems. During several years of teaching the production engineer- ing courses in academia and in the industry, the authors realized that there is a need for a textbook that reflects the current practice of what the modern production engineers do. Currently available books fail to provide adequate information about how the engineering principles are ap- plied to solving petroleum production engineering prob- lems with modern computer technologies. These facts motivated the authors to write this new book. This book is written primarily for production engineers and college students of senior level as well as graduate level. It is not authors’ intention to simply duplicate gen- eral information that can be found from other books. This book gathers authors’ experiences gained through years of teaching courses of petroleum production engineering in universities and in the petroleum industry. The mission of the book is to provide production engineers a handy guide- line to designing, analyzing, and optimizing petroleum production systems. The original manuscript of this book has been used as a textbook for college students of under- graduate and graduate levels in Petroleum Engineering. This book was intended to cover the full scope of pe- troleum production engineering. Following the sequence of oil and gas production process, this book presents its contents in eighteen chapters covered in four parts. Part I contains eight chapters covering petroleum pro- duction engineering fundamentals as the first course for the entry-level production engineers and undergraduate students. Chapter 1 presents an introduction to the petro- leum production system. Chapter 2 documents properties of oil and natural gases that are essential for designing and analysing oil and gas production systems. Chapters 3 through 6 cover in detail the performance of oil and gas wells. Chapter 7 presents techniques used to forecast well production for economics analysis. Chapter 8 describes empirical models for production decline analysis. Part II includes three chapters presenting principles and rules of designing and selecting the main components of petroleum production systems. These chapters are also written for entry-level production engineers and under- graduate students. Chapter 9 addresses tubing design. Chapter 10 presents rule of thumbs for selecting com- ponents in separation and dehydration systems. Chapter 11 details principles of selecting liquid pumps, gas com- pressors, and pipelines for oil and gas transportation. Part III consists of three chapters introducing artificial lift methods as the second course for the entry-level pro- duction engineers and undergraduate students. Chapter 12 presents an introduction to the sucker rod pumping system and its design procedure. Chapter 13 describes briefly gas lift method. Chapter 14 provides an over view of other artificial lift methods and design procedures. Part IV is composed of four chapters addressing pro- duction enhancement techniques. They are designed for production engineers with some experience and graduatestudents. Chapter 15 describes how to identify well prob- lems. Chapter 16 deals with designing acidizing jobs. Chapter 17 provides a guideline to hydraulic fracturing and job evaluation techniques. Chapter 18 presents some relevant information on production optimisation tech- niques. Since the substance of this book is virtually boundless in depth, knowing what to omit was the greatest difficulty with its editing. The authors believe that it requires many books to describe the foundation of knowledge in petro- leum production engineering. To counter any deficiency that might arise from the limitations of space, the book provides a reference list of books and papers at the end of each chapter so that readers should experience little diffi- culty in pursuing each topic beyond the presented scope. Regarding presentation, this book focuses on presen- ting and illustrating engineering principles used for designing and analyzing petroleum production systems rather than in-depth theories. Derivation of mathematical models is beyond the scope of this book, except for some special topics. Applications of the principles are illustrated by solving example problems. While the solutions to some simple problems not involving iterative procedures are demonstrated with stepwise calculations, compli- cated problems are solved with computer spreadsheet programs. The programs can be downloaded from the publisher’s website ( http://books.elsevier.com/companions/ 9780750682701 ). The combination of the book and the computer programs provides a perfect tool kit to petrol- eum production engineers for performing their daily work in a most efficient manner. All the computer programs were written in spreadsheet form in MS Excel that is available in most computer platforms in the petroleum industry. These spreadsheets are accurate and very easy to use. Although the U.S. field units are used in the com- panion book, options of using U.S. field units and SI units are provided in the spreadsheet programs. This book is based on numerous documents including reports and papers accumulated through years of work in the University of Louisiana at Lafayette and the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology. The authors are grateful to the universities for permissions of publish- ing the materials. Special thanks go to the Chevron and American Petroleum Institute (API) for providing Chev- ron Professorship and API Professorship in Petroleum Engineering throughout editing of this book. Our thanks are due to Mr. Kai Sun of Baker Oil Tools, who made a thorough review and editing of this book. The authors also thank Malone Mitchell III of Riata Energy for he and his company’s continued support of our efforts to develop new petroleum engineering text and professional books for the continuing education and training of the industry’s vital engineers. On the basis of the collective experiences of authors and reviewer, we expect this book to be of value to the production engineers in the petrol- eum industry.

While the exploration activities find oil and gas reserves, the production activities deliver oil and gas to the downstream of the industry (i.e., processing plants). The petroleum production is definitely the heart of the petroleum industry. Petroleum production engineering is that part of petroleum engineering that attempts to maxi- mize oil and gas production in a cost-effective manner. To achieve this objective, production engineers need to have a thorough understanding of the petroleum production systems with which they work. To perform their job correctly, production engineers should have solid back- ground and sound knowledge about the properties of fluids they produce and working principles of all the major components of producing wells and surface facilities. This part of the book provides graduating production engineers with fundamentals of petroleum production engineering. Materials are presented in the following eight chapters: Chapter 1 Petroleum Production System 1/3 Chapter 2 Properties of Oil and Natural Gas 2/19 Chapter 3 Reservoir Deliverability 3/29 Chapter 4 Wellbore Performance 4/45 Chapter 5 Choke Performance 5/59 Chapter 6 Well Deliverability 6/69 Chapter 7 Forecast of Well Production 7/87 Chapter 8 Production Decline Analysis 8/971Petroleum Production System Contents 1.1 Introduction 1/4 1.2 Reservoir 1/4 1.3 Well 1/5 1.4 Separator 1/8 1.5 Pump 1/9 1.6 Gas Compressor 1/10 1.7 Pipelines 1/11 1.8 Safety Control System 1/11 1.9 Unit Systems 1/17 Summary 1/17 References 1/17 Problems 1/171.1 Introduction The role of a production engineer is to maximize oil and gas production in a cost-effective manner. Familiarization and understanding of oil and gas production systems are essential to the engineers. This chapter provides graduat- ing production engineers with some basic knowledge about production systems. More engineering principles are discussed in the later chapters. As shown in Fig. 1.1, a complete oil or gas production system consists of a reservoir, well, flowline, separators, pumps, and transportation pipelines. The reservoir sup- plies wellbore with crude oil or gas. The well provides a path for the production fluid to flow from bottom hole to surface and offers a means to control the fluid production rate. The flowline leads the produced fluid to separators. The separators remove gas and water from the crude oil. Pumps and compressors are used to transport oil and gas through pipelines to sales points. 1.2 Reservoir Hydrocarbon accumulations in geological traps can be clas- sified as reservoir, field, and pool. A ‘‘reservoir’’ is a porous and permeable underground formation containing an indi- vidual bank of hydrocarbons confined by impermeable rock or water barriers and is characterized by a single natural pressure system. A ‘‘field’’ is an area that consists of one or more reservoirs all related to the same structural feature. A ‘‘pool’’ contains one or more reservoirs in isolated structures. Depending on the initial reservoir condition in the phase diagram (Fig. 1.2), hydrocarbon accumulations are classi- fied as oil, gas condensate, and gas reservoirs. An oil that is at a pressure above its bubble-point pressure is called an ‘‘undersaturated oil’’ because it can dissolve more gas at the given temperature. An oil that is at its bubble-point pressure is called a ‘‘saturated oil’’ because it can dissolveno more gas at the given temperature. Single (liquid)-phase flow prevails in an undersaturated oil reservoir, whereas two-phase (liquid oil and free gas) flow exists in a sat- urated oil reservoir. Wells in the same reservoir can fall into categories of oil, condensate, and gas wells depending on the producing gas–oil ratio (GOR). Gas wells are wells with producing GOR being greater than 100,000 scf/stb; condensate wells are those with producing GOR being less than 100,000 scf/stb but greater than 5,000 scf/stb; and wells with producing GOR being less than 5,000 scf/stb are classified as oil wells. Oil reservoirs can be classified on the basis of boundary type, which determines driving mechanism, and which are as follows: .Water-drive reservoir .Gas-cap drive reservoir .Dissolved-gas drive reservoir In water-drive reservoirs, the oil zone is connected by a continuous path to the surface groundwater system (aqui- fer). The pressure caused by the ‘‘column’’ of water to the surface forces the oil (and gas) to the top of the reservoir against the impermeable barrier that restricts the oil and gas (the trap boundary). This pressure will force the oil and gas toward the wellbore. With the same oil production, reservoir pressure will be maintained longer (relative to other mech- anisms of drive) when there is an active water drive. Edge- water drive reservoir is the most preferable type of reservoir compared to bottom-water drive. The reservoir pressure can remain at its initial value above bubble-point pressure so that single-phase liquid flow exists in the reservoir for maximum well productivity. A steady-state flow condition can prevail in a edge-water drive reservoir for a long time before water breakthrough into the well. Bottom-water drive reservoir (Fig. 1.3) is less preferable because of water-coning problems that can affect oil production economics due to water treat- ment and disposal issues. Wellbore ReservoirSeparator Wellhead PwfPe PGas OilWater Figure 1.1 A sketch of a petroleum production system.1/4 PETROLEUM PRODUCTION ENGINEERING FUNDAMENTALSIn a gas-cap drive reservoir, gas-cap drive is the drive mechanism where the gas in the reservoir has come out of solution and rises to the top of the reservoir to form a gas cap (Fig. 1.4). Thus, the oil below the gas cap can be produced. If the gas in the gas cap is taken out of the reservoir early in the production process, the reservoir pressure will decrease rapidly. Sometimes an oil reservoir is subjected to both water and gas-cap drive. A dissolved-gas drive reservoir (Fig. 1.5) is also called a ‘‘solution-gas drive reservoir’’ and ‘‘volumetric reservoir.’’ The oil reservoir has a fixed oil volume surrounded by no- flow boundaries (faults or pinch-outs). Dissolved-gas drive is the drive mechanism where the reservoir gas is held insolution in the oil (and water). The reservoir gas is actually in a liquid form in a dissolved solution with the liquids (at atmospheric conditions) from the reservoir. Compared to the water- and gas-drive reservoirs, expansion of solution (dissolved) gas in the oil provides a weak driving mech- anism in a volumetric reservoir. In the regions where the oil pressure drops to below the bubble-point pressure, gas escapes from the oil and oil–gas two-phase flow exists. To improve oil recovery in the solution-gas reservoir, early pressure maintenance is usually preferred. 1.3 Well Oil and gas wells are drilled like an upside-down telescope. The large-diameter borehole section is at the top of the well. Each section is cased to the surface, or a liner is placed in the well that laps over the last casing in the well. Each casing or liner is cemented into the well (usually up to at least where the cement overlaps the previous cement job). The last casing in the well is the production casing (or production liner). Once the production casing has been cemented into the well, the production tubing is run into the well. Usually a packer is used near the bottom of the tubing to isolate the annulus between the outside of the tubing and the inside of the casing. Thus, the produced fluids are forced to move out of the perforation into the bottom of the well and then into the inside of the tubing. Packers can be actuated by either mechanical or hydraulic mechanisms. The production tubing is often (particularly during initial well flow) provided with a bottom-hole choke to control the initial well flow (i.e., to restrict over- production and loss of reservoir pressure). Figure 1.6 shows a typical flowing oil well, defined as a well producing solely because of the natural pressure of the reservoir. It is composed of casings, tubing, packers, down-hole chokes (optional), wellhead, Christmas tree, and surface chokes.0 50 150 200 250 300 350 1001,000 5001,5002,0002,5003,0003,5004,000 Reservoir Temperature ( /H11034F)Reservoir Pressure (psia) Liquid Volume40%20% 10%80% 5% 0%BubblePointGas Reservoirs Retrograde Condensate Reservoirs Critical Pointpi, T ptf, Ttfpwf, TwfDew Point Cricondentherm Point Figure 1.2 A typical hydrocarbon phase diagram. WaterWOCOil Figure 1.3 A sketch of a water-drive reservoir.PETROLEUM PRODUCTION SYSTEM 1/5Most wells produce oil through tubing strings, mainly because a tubing string provides good sealing performance and allows the use of gas expansion to lift oil. The Ameri- can Petroleum Institute (API) defines tubing size using nominal diameter and weight (per foot). The nominal diameter is based on the internal diameter of the tubing body. The weight of tubing determines the tubing outer diameter. Steel grades of tubing are designated H-40, J-55, C-75, L-80, N-80, C-90, and P-105, where the digits repre- sent the minimum yield strength in 1,000 psi. The min- imum performance properties of tubing are given in Chapter 9 and Appendix B.The ‘‘wellhead’’ is defined as the surface equipment set below the master valve. As we can see in Fig. 1.7, it includes casing heads and a tubing head. The casing head (lowermost) is threaded onto the surface casing. This can also be a flanged or studded connection. A ‘‘casing head’’ is a mechanical assembly used for hanging a casing string (Fig. 1.8). Depending on casing programs in well drilling, several casing heads can be installed during well construc- tion. The casing head has a bowl that supports the casing hanger. This casing hanger is threaded onto the top of the production casing (or uses friction grips to hold the cas- ing). As in the case of the production tubing, the produc- tion casing is landed in tension so that the casing hanger actually supports the production casing (down to the freeze point). In a similar manner, the intermediate cas- ing(s) are supported by their respective casing hangers (and bowls). All of these casing head arrangements are supported by the surface casing, which is in compression and cemented to the surface. A well completed with three casing strings has two casing heads. The uppermost casing head supports the production casing. The lowermost cas- ing head sits on the surface casing (threaded to the top of the surface casing). Most flowing wells are produced through a string of tubing run inside the production casing string. At the surface, the tubing is supported by the tubing head (i.e., the tubing head is used for hanging tubing string on the production casing head [Fig. 1.9]). The tubing head sup- ports the tubing string at the surface (this tubing is landed on the tubing head so that it is in tension all the way down to the packer). The equipment at the top of the producing wellhead is called a ‘‘Christmas tree’’ (Fig. 1.10) and it is used to control flow. The ‘‘Christmas tree’’ is installed above the tubing head. An ‘‘adaptor’’ is a piece of equipment used to join the two. The ‘‘Christmas tree’’ may have one flow outlet (a tee) or two flow outlets (a cross). The master valve is installed below the tee or cross. To replace a master valve, the tubing must be plugged. A Christmas tree consists of a main valve, wing valves, and a needle valve. These valves are used for closing the well when needed. At the top of the tee structure (on the top of the ‘‘Christmas tree’’), there is a pressure gauge that indicates the pressure in the tubing.Gas Cap Oil Figure 1.4 A sketch of a gas-cap drive reservoir. Oil and Gas Reservoir Figure 1.5 A sketch of a dissolved-gas drive reservoir.1/6 PETROLEUM PRODUCTION ENGINEERING FUNDAMENTALSThe wing valves and their gauges allow access (for pressure measurements and gas or liquid flow) to the annulus spaces (Fig. 1.11). ‘‘Surface choke’’ (i.e., a restriction in the flowline) is a piece of equipment used to control the flow rate (Fig. 1.12). In most flowing wells, the oil production rate is altered by adjusting the choke size. The choke causes back-pressurein the line. The back-pressure (caused by the chokes or other restrictions in the flowline) increases the bottom- hole flowing pressure. Increasing the bottom-hole flowing pressure decreases the pressure drop from the reservoir to the wellbore (pressure drawdown). Thus, increasing the back-pressure in the wellbore decreases the flow rate from the reservoir. In some wells, chokes are installed in the lower section of tubing strings. This choke arrangement reduces well- head pressure and enhances oil production rate as a result of gas expansion in the tubing string. For gas wells, use of down-hole chokes minimizes the gas hydrate problem in the well stream. A major disadvantage of using down-hole chokes is that replacing a choke is costly. Certain procedures must be followed to open or close a well. Before opening, check all the surface equipment such as safety valves, fittings, and so on. The burner of a line heater must be lit before the well is opened. This is neces- sary because the pressure drop across a choke cools the fluid and may cause gas hydrates or paraffin to deposit out. A gas burner keeps the involved fluid (usually water) hot. Fluid from the well is carried through a coil of piping. The choke is installed in the heater. Well fluid is heated both before and after it flows through the choke. The upstream heating helps melt any solids that may be present in the producing fluid. The downstream heating prevents hydrates and paraffins from forming at the choke. Surface vessels should be open and clear before the well is allowed to flow. All valves that are in the master valve and other downstream valves are closed. Then follow the following procedure to open a well: 1. The operator barely opens the master valve (just a crack), and escaping fluid makes a hissing sound. When the fluid no longer hisses through the valve, the pressure has been equalized, and then the master valve is opened wide. 2. If there are no oil leaks, the operator cracks the next downstream valve that is closed. Usually, this will beCasing PerforationWellhead Oil ReservoirPackerBottom-hole ChokeTubingAnnulusProduction Ca singIntermediate CasingSurface Casing Cement Wellbore Reservoir Figure 1.6 A sketch of a typical flowing oil well.

Again, when the hissing sound stops, the valve is opened wide. 3. The operator opens the other downstream valves the same way. 4. To read the tubing pressure gauge, the operator must open the needle valve at the top of the Christmas tree. After reading and recording the pressure, the operator may close the valve again to protect the gauge. The procedure for ‘‘shutting-in’’ a well is the opposite of the procedure for opening a well. In shutting-in the well, the master valve is closed last. Valves are closed rather rapidly to avoid wearing of the valve (to prevent erosion). At least two valves must be closed.1.4 Separator The fluids produced from oil wells are normally complex mixtures of hundreds of different compounds. A typical oil well stream is a high-velocity, turbulent, constantly expanding mixture of gases and hydrocarbon liquids, in- timately mixed with water vapor, free water, and some- times solids. The well stream should be processed as soon as possible after bringing them to the surface. Separators are used for the purpose. Three types of separators are generally available from manufacturers: horizontal, vertical, and spherical sep- arators. Horizontal separators are further classified intoBowl Production Casing Casing  Head Surface CasingCasing Hanger Figure 1.8 A sketch of a casing head.Bowl Seal TubingHanger Tubing Head Figure 1.9 A sketch of a tubing head.

Each type of separator has specific advantages and limitations. Selec- tion of separator type is based on several factors including characteristics of production steam to be treated, floor space availability at the facility site, transportation, and cost. Horizontal separators (Fig. 1.13) are usually the first choice because of their low costs. Horizontal separators are almost widely used for high-GOR well streams, foam- ing well streams, or liquid-from-liquid separation. They have much greater gas–liquid interface because of a large, long, baffled gas-separation section. Horizontal sep- arators are easier to skid-mount and service and require less piping for field connections. Individual separators can be stacked easily into stage-separation assemblies to min- imize space requirements. In horizontal separators, gas flows horizontally while liquid droplets fall toward the liquid surface. The moisture gas flows in the baffle surface and forms a liquid film that is drained away to the liquid section of the separator. The baffles need to be longer than the distance of liquid trajectory travel. The liquid-level control placement is more critical in a horizontal separator than in a vertical separator because of limited surge space. Vertical separators are often used to treat low to inter- mediate GOR well streams and streams with relatively large slugs of liquid. They handle greater slugs of liquid without carryover to the gas outlet, and the action of the liquid-level control is not as critical. Vertical separators occupy less floor space, which is important for facility sitessuch as those on offshore platforms where space is limited. Because of the large vertical distance between the liquid level and the gas outlet, the chance for liquid to re-vapor- ize into the gas phase is limited. However, because of the natural upward flow of gas in a vertical separator against the falling droplets of liquid, adequate separator diameter is required. Vertical separators are more costly to fabricate and ship in skid-mounted assemblies. Spherical separators offer an inexpensive and compact means of separation arrangement. Because of their com- pact configurations, these types of separators have a very limited surge space and liquid-settling section. Also, the placement and action of the liquid-level control in this type of separator is more critical. Chapter 10 provides more details on separators and dehydrators. 1.5 Pump After separation, oil is transported through pipelines to the sales points. Reciprocating piston pumps are used to provide mechanical energy required for the transportation. There are two types of piston strokes, the single-actionHandwheel Packing Gate Port Figure 1.11 A sketch of a surface valve.Wellhead Choke Figure 1.12 A sketch of a wellhead choke. Figure 1.13 Conventional horizontal separator. (Courtesy Petroleum Extension Services.)PETROLEUM PRODUCTION SYSTEM 1/9piston stroke and the double-action piston stroke. The double-action stroke is used for duplex (two pistons) pumps. The single-action stroke is used for pumps with three pistons or greater (e.g., triplex pump). Figure 1.14 shows how a duplex pump works. More information about pumps is presented in Chapter 11. 1.6 Gas Compressor Compressors are used for providing gas pressure required to transport gas with pipelines and to lift oil in gas-lift operations. The compressors used in today’s natural gas production industry fall into two distinct types: reciprocat- ing and rotary compressors. Reciprocating compressors are most commonly used in the natural gas industry. They are built for practically all pressures and volumetric capacities.As shown in Fig. 1.15, reciprocating compressors have more moving parts and, therefore, lower mechanical efficiencies than rotary compressors. Each cylinder assembly of a recip- rocating compressor consists of a piston, cylinder, cylinder heads, suction and discharge valves, and other parts neces- sary to convert rotary motion to reciprocation motion. A reciprocating compressor is designed for a certain range of compression ratios through the selection of proper piston displacement and clearance volume within the cylinder. This clearance volume can be either fixed or variable, depending on the extent of the operation range and the percent of load variation desired. A typical reciprocating compressor can deliver a volumetric gas flow rate up to 30,000 cubic feet per minute (cfm) at a discharge pressure up to 10,000 psig. Rotary compressors are divided into two classes: the centrifugal compressor and the rotary blower.

(Courtesy Petroleum Extension Services.)1/10 PETROLEUM PRODUCTION ENGINEERING FUNDAMENTALSgal compressor consists of a housing with flow passages, a rotating shaft on which the impeller is mounted, bearings, and seals to prevent gas from escaping along the shaft. Centrifugal compressors have few moving parts because only the impeller and shaft rotate. Thus, its efficiency is high and lubrication oil consumption and maintenance costs are low. Cooling water is normally unnecessary be- cause of lower compression ratio and less friction loss. Compression rates of centrifugal compressors are lower because of the absence of positive displacement. Centrifu- gal compressors compress gas using centrifugal force. In this type of compressor, work is done on the gas by an impeller. Gas is then discharged at a high velocity into a diffuser where the velocity is reduced and its kinetic energy is converted to static pressure. Unlike reciprocating com- pressors, all this is done without confinement and physical squeezing. Centrifugal compressors with relatively unre- stricted passages and continuous flow are inherently high- capacity, low-pressure ratio machines that adapt easily to series arrangements within a station. In this way, each compressor is required to develop only part of the station compression ratio. Typically, the volume is more than 100,000 cfm and discharge pressure is up to 100 psig. More information about different types of compressors is provided in Chapter 11. 1.7 Pipelines The first pipeline was built in the United States in 1859 to transport crude oil (Wolbert, 1952). Through the one and half century of pipeline operating practice, the petro- leum industry has proven that pipelines are by far themost economical means of large-scale overland transpor- tation for crude oil, natural gas, and their products, clearly superior to rail and truck transportation over competing routes, given large quantities to be moved on a regular basis. Transporting petroleum fluids with pipelines is a continuous and reliable operation. Pipelines have demonstrated an ability to adapt to a wide variety of environments including remote areas and hostile environ- ments. With very minor exceptions, largely due to local peculiarities, most refineries are served by one or more pipelines, because of their superior flexibility to the alternatives. Figure 1.16 shows applications of pipelines in offshore operations. It indicates flowlines transporting oil and/or gas from satellite subsea wells to subsea manifolds, flow- lines transporting oil and/or gas from subsea manifolds to production facility platforms, infield flowlines transport- ing oil and/or gas from between production facility plat- forms, and export pipelines transporting oil and/or gas from production facility platforms to shore. The pipelines are sized to handle the expected pressure and fluid flow. To ensure desired flow rate of product, pipeline size varies significantly from project to project. To contain the pressures, wall thicknesses of the pipelines range from3⁄8inch to 11⁄2inch. More information about pipelines is provided in Chapter 11. 1.8 Safety Control System The purpose of safety systems is to protect personnel, the environment, and the facility.

This chapter presents definitions of these fluid properties and some means of obtaining these property values other than experimental measurements. Applications of the fluid properties appear in subsequent chapters. 2.2 Properties of Oil Oil properties include solution gas–oil ratio (GOR), density, formation volume factor, viscosity, and compress- ibility. The latter four properties are interrelated through solution GOR. 2.2.1 Solution Gas–Oil Ratio ‘‘Solution GOR’’ is defined as the amount of gas (in standard condition) that will dissolve in unit volume of oil when both are taken down to the reservoir at the prevailing pressure and temperature; that is, Rs¼Vgas Voil,( 2:1) where Rs¼solution GOR (in scf/stb) Vgas¼gas volume in standard condition (scf) Voil¼oil volume in stock tank condition (stb) The ‘‘standard condition’’ is defined as 14.7 psia and 608F in most states in the United States. At a given reservoir temperature, solution GOR remains constant at pressures above bubble-point pressure. It drops as pressure decreases in the pressure range below the bubble-point pressure. Solution GOR is measured in PTV laboratories. Empirical correlations are also available based on data from PVT labs. One of the correlations is, Rs¼ggp 18100:0125(/C14API) 100:00091 t/C20/C21 1:2048 (2:2) where ggand8API are defined in the latter sections, and pand tare pressure and temperature in psia and 8F, respectively. Solution GOR factor is often used for volumetric oil and gas calculations in reservoir engineering. It is also used as a base parameter for estimating other fluid properties such as density of oil. 2.2.2 Density of Oil ‘‘Density of oil’’ is defined as the mass of oil per unit volume, or lb m=ft3in U.S. Field unit. It is widely used in hydraulics calculations (e.g., wellbore and pipeline per- formance calculations [see Chapters 4 and 11]). Because of gas content, density of oil is pressure depen- dent. The density of oil at standard condition (stock tank oil) is evaluated by API gravity. The relationship between the density of stock tank oil and API gravity is given through the following relations: /C14API¼141:5 go/C0131:5( 2:3) and go¼ro,st rw,( 2:4) where 8API¼API gravity of stock tank oil go¼specific gravity of stock tank oil, 1 for freshwaterro,st¼density of stock tank oil, lb m=ft3 rw¼density of freshwater, 62 :4l b m=ft3 The density of oil at elevated pressures and temperatures can be estimated on empirical correlations developed by a number of investigators. Ahmed (1989) gives a summary of correlations. Engineers should select and validate the correlations carefully with measurements before adopting any correlations. Standing (1981) proposed a correlation for estimating the oil formation volume factor as a function of solution GOR, specific gravity of stock tank oil, specific gravity of solution gas, and temperature. By coupling the mathemat- ical definition of the oil formation volume factor with Standing’s correlation, Ahmed (1989) presented the fol- lowing expression for the density of oil: ro¼62:4goþ0:0136Rsgg 0:972þ0:000147 Rsﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃgg gor þ1:25t/C20/C211:175,( 2:5) where t¼temperature, 8F gg¼specific gravity of gas, 1 for air. 2.2.3 Formation Volume Factor of Oil ‘‘Formation volume factor of oil’’ is defined as the volume occupied in the reservoir at the prevailing pressure and temperature by volume of oil in stock tank, plus its dis- solved gas; that is, Bo¼Vres Vst,( 2:6) where Bo¼formation volume factor of oil (rb/stb) Vres¼oil volume in reservoir condition (rb) Vst¼oil volume in stock tank condition (stb) Formation volume factor of oil is always greater than unity because oil dissolves more gas in reservoir condition than in stock tank condition. At a given reservoir tempera- ture, oil formation volume factor remains nearly constant at pressures above bubble-point pressure. It drops as pres- sure decreases in the pressure range below the bubble- point pressure. Formation volume factor of oil is measured in PTV labs. Numerous empirical correlations are available based on data from PVT labs. One of the correlations is Bo¼0:9759þ0:00012 Rsﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃgg gor þ1:25t/C20/C211:2 : (2:7) Formation volume factor of oil is often used for oil volumet- riccalculationsandwell-inflowcalculations.Itisalsousedas a base parameter for estimating other fluid properties. 2.2.4 Viscosity of Oil ‘‘Viscosity’’ is an empirical parameter used for describing the resistance to flow of fluid. The viscosity of oil is of interest in well-inflow and hydraulics calculations in oil production engineering. While the viscosity of oil can be measured in PVT labs, it is often estimated using empirical correlations developed by a number of investigators including Beal (1946), Beggs and Robinson (1975), Stand- ing (1981), Glaso (1985), Khan (1987), and Ahmed (1989). A summary of these correlations is given by Ahmed (1989). Engineers should select and validate a correlation with measurements before it is used. Standing’s (1981) correlation for dead oil is expressed as mod¼0:32þ1:8/C2107 API4:53/C18/C19360 tþ200/C18/C19A ,( 2:8)2/20 PETROLEUM PRODUCTION ENGINEERING FUNDAMENTALSwhere A¼100:43þ8:33 APIðÞ(2:9) and mod¼viscosity of dead oil (cp).

Oil compressibility is measured from PVT labs. It is often used in modeling well-inflow performance and reservoir simulation.

The first two are com- position dependent.The latter four are pressure dependent. 2.3.1 Specific Gravity of Gas ‘‘Specific gravity gas’’ is defined as the ratio of the appar- ent molecular weight of the gas to that of air. The molecu- lar weight of air is usually taken as equal to 28.97 ( /C2479% nitrogen and 21% oxygen). Therefore, the gas-specific gravity is gg¼MW a 28:97,( 2:18) where MW ais the apparent molecular weight of gas, which can be calculated on the basis of gas composition. Gas composition is usually determined in a laboratory and reported in mole fractions of components in the gas. Let yibe the mole fraction of component i, and the apparent molecular weight of the gas can be formulated using a mixing rule such as MW a¼XNc i¼1yiMW i,( 2:19) where MW iis the molecular weight of component i, and Ncis number of components. The molecular weights of compounds ( MW i) can be found in textbooks on organic chemistry or petroleum fluids such as that by Ahmed (1989). Gas-specific gravity varies between 0.55 and 0.9. 2.3.2 Gas Pseudo-Critical Pressure and Temperature Similar to gas apparent molecular weight, the critical properties of a gas can be determined on the basis of the critical properties of compounds in the gas using the mix- ing rule. The gas critical properties determined in such a way are called ‘‘pseudo-critical properties.’’ Gas pseudo- critical pressure ( ppc) and pseudo-critical temperature (Tpc) are, respectively, expressed as ppc¼XNc i¼1yipci (2:20) and Tpc¼XNc i¼1yiTci,( 2:21)where pciandTciare critical pressure and critical tempera- ture of component i, respectively. Example Problem 2.2 For the gas composition given in the following text, determine apparent molecular weight, specific gravity, pseudo-critical pressure, and pseudo- critical temperature of the gas. Solution Example Problem 2.2 is solved with the spreadsheet program MixingRule.xls . Results are shown in Table 2.2. If the gas composition is not known but gas-specific gravity is given, the pseudo-critical pressure and tempera- ture can be determined from various charts or correlations developed based on the charts. One set of simple cor- relations is ppc¼709:604/C058:718gg (2:22) Tpc¼170:491þ307:344gg,( 2:23) which are valid for H 2S<3%, N 2<5%, and total content of inorganic compounds less than 7%. Corrections for impurities in sour gases are always necessary. The corrections can be made using either charts or correlations such as the Wichert and Aziz (1972) correction expressed as follows: A¼yH2SþyCO 2 (2:24) B¼yH2S (2:25) Table 2.2 Results Given by the Spreadsheet Program MixingRule.xls MixingRule.xls Description: This spreadsheet calculates gas apparent molecular weight, specific gravity, pseudo-critical pressure, and pseudo-critical temperature.

Kinematic viscosity ( ng) is related to the dynamic viscosity through density ( rg), ng¼mg rg: (2:33) Kinematic viscosity is not typically used in natural gas engineering. Direct measurements of gas viscosity are preferred for a new gas. If gas composition and viscosities of gas com- ponents are known, the mixing rule can be used to deter- mine the viscosity of the gas mixture: mg¼P(mgiyiﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃMW ip)P(yiﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃMW ip)(2:34) Viscosity of gas is very often estimated with charts or correlations developed based on the charts. Gas viscosity correlation of Carr et al. 1954 involves a two-step pro- cedure: The gas viscosity at temperature and atmospheric pressure is estimated first from gas-specific gravity and inorganic compound content. The atmospheric value is then adjusted to pressure conditions by means of a correc- tion factor on the basis of reduced temperature and pres- sure state of the gas. The atmospheric pressure viscosity (m1) can be expressed as m1¼m1HCþm1N2þm1CO 2þm1H2S,( 2:35) where m1HC¼8:188/C210/C03/C06:15/C210/C03log (gg) þ(1:709/C210/C05/C02:062/C210/C06gg)T,( 2:36) m1N2¼[9:59/C210/C03þ8:48/C210/C03log (gg)]yN2,( 2:37) m1CO 2¼[6:24/C210/C03þ9:08/C210/C03log (gg)]yCO 2,( 2 :38) m1H2S¼[3:73/C210/C03þ8:49/C210/C03log (gg)]yH2S,( 2 :39) Dempsey (1965) developed the following relation:mr¼lnmg m1Tpr/C18/C19 ¼a0þa1pprþa2p2 prþa3p3 prþTpr(a4þa5ppr þa6p2 prþa7p3 pr)þT2 pr(a8þa9pprþa10p2 pr þa11p3 pr)þT3 pr(a12þa13pprþa14p2 pr þa15p3 pr), (2 :40) where a0¼/C0 2:46211820 a1¼2:97054714 a2¼/C0 0:28626405 a3¼0:00805420 a4¼2:80860949 a5¼/C0 3:49803305 a6¼0:36037302 a7¼/C0 0:01044324 a8¼/C0 0:79338568 a9¼1:39643306 a10¼/C0 0:14914493 a11¼0:00441016 a12¼0:08393872 a13¼/C0 0:18640885 a14¼0:02033679 a15¼/C0 0:00060958 Thus, once the value of mris determined from the right- hand side of this equation, gas viscosity at elevated pres- sure can be readily calculated using the following relation: mg¼m1 Tpremr (2:41) Other correlations for gas viscosity include that of Dean and Stiel (1958) and Lee et al. (1966). Example Problem 2.3 A 0.65 specific–gravity natural gas contains 10% nitrogen, 8% carbon dioxide, and 2% hydrogen sulfide. Estimate viscosity of the gas at 10,000 psia and 180 8F. Solution Example Problem 2.3 is solved with the spread- sheet Carr-Kobayashi-Burrows-GasViscosity.xls , which is attached to this book. The result is shown in Table 2.3. 2.3.4 Gas Compressibility Factor Gas compressibility factor is also called ‘‘deviation factor’’ or ‘‘z-factor.’’ Its value reflects how much the real gas deviates from the ideal gas at a given pressure and tem- perature. Definition of the compressibility factor is expressed as z¼Vactual Videal gas: (2:42) Introducing the z-factor to the gas law for ideal gas results in the gas law for real gas as pV¼nzRT ,( 2:43) where nis the number of moles of gas. When pressure pis entered in psia, volume Vin ft3, and temperature in 8R, the gas constant Ris equal to10.73psia/C0ft3 mole/C0/C14R. Gas compressibility factor can be determined on the basis of measurements in PVT laboratories. For a given amount of gas, if temperature is kept constant and volume is mea- sured at 14.7 psia and an elevated pressure p1, z-factor can then be determined with the following formula: z¼p1 14:7V1 V0,( 2:44)PROPERTIES OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS 2/23where V0andV1are gas volumes measured at 14.7 psia andp1, respectively. Very often the z-factor is estimated with the chart devel- oped by Standing and Katz (1954). This chart has been set up for computer solution by a number of individuals. Brill and Beggs (1974) yield z-factor values accurate enough for many engineering calculations. Brill and Beggs’ z-factor correlation is expressed as follows: A¼1:39(Tpr/C00:92)0:5/C00:36Tpr/C00:10, (2 :45) B¼(0:62/C00:23Tpr)ppr þ0:066 Tpr/C00:86/C00:037/C18/C19 p2 prþ0:32p6 pr 10E,( 2:46) C¼0:132/C00:32 log ( Tpr), (2 :47) D¼10F,( 2:48) E¼9(Tpr/C01), (2 :49) F¼0:3106/C00:49Tprþ0:1824T2 pr,( 2:50) and z¼Aþ1/C0A eBþCpD pr: (2:51) Example Problem 2.4 For the natural gas described in Example Problem 2.3, estimate z-factor at 5,000 psia and 1808F.

It is a major factor affecting well deliverability. Reservoir deliverability determines types of completion and artificial lift methods to be used. A thorough knowl- edge of reservoir productivity is essential for production engineers. Reservoir deliverability depends on several factors in- cluding the following: .Reservoir pressure .Pay zone thickness and permeability .Reservoir boundary type and distance .Wellbore radius .Reservoir fluid properties .Near-wellbore condition .Reservoir relative permeabilities Reservoir deliverability can be mathematically modeled on the basis of flow regimes such as transient flow, steady state flow, and pseudo–steady state flow. An analytical relation between bottom-hole pressure and production rate can be formulated for a given flow regime. The relation is called ‘‘inflow performance relationship’’ (IPR). This chapter addresses the procedures used for establishing IPR of different types of reservoirs and well configurations. 3.2 Flow Regimes When a vertical well is open to produce oil at production rateq, it creates a pressure funnel of radius raround the wellbore, as illustrated by the dotted line in Fig. 3.1a. In this reservoir model, the his the reservoir thickness, kis the effective horizontal reservoir permeability to oil, mois viscosity of oil, Bois oil formation volume factor, rwis wellbore radius, pwfis the flowing bottom hole pressure, andpis the pressure in the reservoir at the distance rfrom the wellbore center line. The flow stream lines in the cylindrical region form a horizontal radial flow pattern as depicted in Fig. 3.1b. 3.2.1 Transient Flow ‘‘Transient flow’’ is defined as a flow regime where/when the radius of pressure wave propagation from wellbore has not reached any boundaries of the reservoir. During tran- sient flow, the developing pressure funnel is small relative to the reservoir size. Therefore, the reservoir acts like an infinitively large reservoir from transient pressure analysis point of view. Assuming single-phase oil flow in the reservoir, several analytical solutions have been developed for describing the transient flow behavior. They are available from classic textbooks such as that of Dake (1978). A constant-rate solution expressed by Eq. (3.1) is frequently used in pro- duction engineering: pwf¼pi/C0162:6qBomo kh /C2logtþlogk fmoctr2 w/C03:23þ0:87S/C18/C19 ,( 3:1) where pwf¼flowing bottom-hole pressure, psia pi¼initial reservoir pressure, psia q¼oil production rate, stb/day mo¼viscosity of oil, cp k¼effective horizontal permeability to oil, md h¼reservoir thickness, ft t¼flow time, hourf¼porosity, fraction ct¼total compressibility, psi/C01 rw¼wellbore radius to the sand face, ft S¼skin factor Log¼10-based logarithm log10 Because oil production wells are normally operated at constant bottom-hole pressure because of constant well- head pressure imposed by constant choke size, a constant bottom-hole pressure solution is more desirable for well- inflow performance analysis. With an appropriate inner boundary condition arrangement, Earlougher (1977) developed a constant bottom-hole pressure solution, which is similar to Eq. (3.1): q¼kh(pi/C0pwf) 162:6Bomologtþlogk fmoctr2 w/C03:23þ0:87S/C18/C19 , (3:2) which is used for transient well performance analysis in production engineering. Equation (3.2) indicates that oil rate decreases with flow time. This is because the radius of the pressure funnel, over which the pressure drawdown ( pi/C0pwf) acts, increases with time, that is, the overall pressure gradient in the reservoir drops with time. For gas wells, the transient solution is qg¼kh[m(pi)/C0m(pwf)] 1;638Tlogtþlogk fmoctr2 w/C03:23þ0:87S/C18/C19 ,( 3 :3) where qgis production rate in Mscf/d, Tis temperature in 8R, and m(p) is real gas pseudo-pressure defined as m(p)¼ðp pb2p mzdp: (3:4)rwrpwfp moBo khq (a) kmoBop pwfr (b)rw Figure 3.1 A sketch of a radial flow reservoir model: ( a) lateral view, ( b) top view.3/30 PETROLEUM PRODUCTION ENGINEERING FUNDAMENTALSThe real gas pseudo-pressure can be readily determined with the spreadsheet program PseudoPressure.xls . 3.2.2 Steady-State Flow ‘‘Steady-state flow’’ is defined as a flow regime where the pressure at any point in the reservoir remains constant over time. This flow condition prevails when the pressure funnel shown in Fig. 3.1 has propagated to a constant- pressure boundary. The constant-pressure boundary can be an aquifer or a water injection well. A sketch of the reservoir model is shown in Fig. 3.2, where perepresents the pressure at the constant-pressure boundary. Assuming single-phase flow, the following theoretical relation can be derived from Darcy’s law for an oil reservoir under the steady-state flow condition due to a circular constant- pressure boundary at distance refrom wellbore: q¼kh(pe/C0pwf) 141:2Bomolnre rwþS/C16/C17 ,( 3:5) where ‘‘ln’’ denotes 2.718-based natural logarithm loge. Derivation of Eq. (3.5) is left to readers for an exercise. 3.2.3 Pseudo–Steady-State Flow ‘‘Pseudo–steady-state’’ flow is defined as a flow regime where the pressure at any point in the reservoir declines at the same constant rate over time. This flow condition prevails after the pressure funnel shown in Fig. 3.1 has propagated to all no-flow boundaries. A no-flow bound- ary can be a sealing fault, pinch-out of pay zone, or boundaries of drainage areas of production wells. A sketch of the reservoir model is shown in Fig. 3.3, where pe represents the pressure at the no-flow boundary at time t4. Assuming single-phase flow, the following theoretical relation can be derived from Darcy’s law for an oil reser- voir under pseudo–steady-state flow condition due to a circular no-flow boundary at distance refrom wellbore: q¼kh(pe/C0pwf) 141:2Bomolnre rw/C01 2þS/C16/C17 : (3:6)The flow time required for the pressure funnel to reach the circular boundary can be expressed as tpss¼1,200fmoctr2 e k: (3:7) Because the pein Eq. (3.6) is not known at any given time, the following expression using the average reservoir pres- sure is more useful: q¼kh(/C22p p/C0pwf) 141:2Bomolnre rw/C03 4þS/C16/C17 ,( 3:8) where p¯is the average reservoir pressure in psia. Deriv- ations of Eqs. (3.6) and (3.8) are left to readers for exer- cises. If the no-flow boundaries delineate a drainage area of noncircular shape, the following equation should be used for analysis of pseudo–steady-state flow: q¼kh(/C22p p/C0pwf) 141:2Bomo1 2ln4A gCAr2wþS/C16/C17 ,( 3:9) where A¼drainage area, ft2 g¼1:78¼Euler’s constant CA¼drainage area shape factor, 31.6 for a circular boundary.

It is essential to validate these models with test points in field applications. 3.3.1 LPR for Single (Liquid)-Phase Reservoirs All reservoir inflow models represented by Eqs. (3.1), (3.3), (3.7), and (3.8) were derived on the basis of the assumption of single-phase liquid flow. This assumption is valid for under- saturated oil reservoirs, or reservoir portions where the pres- sure is above the bubble-point pressure. These equations define the productivity index ( J/C3) for flowing bottom-hole pressures above the bubble-point pressure as follows: J/C3¼q (pi/C0pwf) ¼kh 162:6Bomologtþlogk fmoctr2 w/C03:23þ0:87S/C18/C19 (3:15) for radial transient flow around a vertical well, J/C3¼q (pe/C0pwf)¼kh 141:2Bomolnre rwþS/C16/C17 (3:16) for radial steady-state flow around a vertical well, J/C3¼q (/C22p p/C0pwf)¼kh 141:2Bomo1 2ln4A gCAr2wþS/C16/C17 (3:17) for pseudo–steady-state flow around a vertical well, and J/C3¼q (pe/C0pwf) ¼kHh 141:2Bmlnaþﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ a2/C0(L=2)2p L=2/C20/C21 þIanih LlnIanih rw(Ianiþ1)hi/C26/C27 (3:18) for steady-state flow around a horizontal well. Since the productivity index ( J/C3) above the bubble-point pressure is independent of production rate, the IPR curve for a single (liquid)-phase reservoi r is simply a straight line drawn from the reservoir pressure to the bubble-point pressure. If the bubble-point pressure is 0 psig, the absolute open flow (AOF) is the productivity index ( J/C3) times the reservoir pressure.

Below the bubble-point pressure, the solution gas escapes from the oil and become free gas. The free gas occupies some portion of pore space, which reduces flow of oil. This effect is quantified by the reduced relative permeability. Also, oil viscosity in- creases as its solution gas content drops. The combination of the relative permeability effect and the viscosity effect results in lower oil production rate at a given bottom-hole pressure. This makes the IPR curve deviating from the linear trend below bubble-point pressure, as shown in Fig. 3.5. The lower the pressure, the larger the devia tion. If the reservoir pressure is below the initial bubble-po int pressure, oil and gas two- phase flow exists in the whole reservoir domain and the reservoir is referred as a ‘‘two-phase reservoir.’’ Only empirical equations are available for modeling IPR of two-phase reservoirs. These empirical equations include Vogel’s (1968) equation extended by Standing (1971), the Fetkovich (1973) equation, Bandakhlia and Aziz’s (1989) equation, Zhang’s (1992) equation, and Retnanto and Economides’ (1998) equation. Vogel’s equa- tion is still widely used in the industry. It is written as q¼qmax1/C00:2pwf /C22p p/C18/C19 /C00:8pwf /C22p p/C18/C192\"# (3:19) or pwf¼0:125 /C22p pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 81/C080q qmax/C18/C19s /C01\"# ,( 3:20) where qmaxis an empirical constant and its value represents the maximum possible value of reservoir deliverability, or AOF. The qmaxcan be theoretically estimated based on res- ervoir pressure and productivity index above the bubble- point pressure. The pseudo–steady-state flow follows that qmax¼J/C3/C22p p 1:8: (3:21) Derivation of this relation is left to the reader for an exercise. Fetkovich’s equation is written as q¼qmax1/C0pwf /C22p p/C18/C192\"#n (3:22)or q¼C(/C22p p2/C0p2 wf)n,( 3:23) where Candnare empirical constants and is related to qmaxbyC¼qmax=/C22p p2n.

This can be done by combining the straight-line IPR model for single-phase flow with Vogel’s IPR model for two-phase flow. Figure 3.10 helps to understand the formulation.

These param- eters determine the constants (e.g., productivity index) in the IPR model. However, the values of these parameters are not always available. Thus, test points (measured val- ues of production rate and flowing bottom-hole pressure) are frequently used for constructing IPR curves. Constructing IPR curves using test points involves back- ing-calculation of the constants in the IPR models. For a single-phase (unsaturated oil) reservoir, the model con- stant J/C3can be determined by J/C3¼q1 (/C22p p/C0pwf1),( 3:29) where q1is the tested production rate at tested flowing bottom-hole pressure pwf1.01,0002,0003,0004,0005,0006,000 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 q (stb/day) pwf (psia) Figure 3.9 IPR curve for Example Problem 3.2. pwf(psi) qo(stb/day) 0 850 565 828 1,130 788 1,695 729 2,260 651 2,826 555 3,000 522 5,651 0pwf 0AOFpi pb qqbqb  =  J  ( p − pb )* 1.8*J pbqV= Figure 3.10 Generalized Vogel IPR model for partial two-phase reservoirs. 01,0002,0003,0004,0005,0006,000 0 200 400 600 800 qo (stb/day)pwf (psia) Figure 3.11 IPR curve for Example Problem 3.3.RESERVOIR DELIVERABILITY 3/35Forapartialtwo-phasereservoir,modelconstant J/C3inthe generalizedVogelequationmustbedeterminedbasedonthe range of tested flowing bottom-hole pressure.

This means that the vertical borehole in the production zone has different layers having different reservoir pressures, permeabilities, and producing fluids. If itis assumedthatthere areno othercommunicationbetween these formations (other than the wellbore), the production will come mainly from the higher permeability layers. As the well’s rate of production is gradually increased, the less consolidated layers will begin to produce one by one (atprogressively lower GOR), and so the overall ratio of pro- duction will fall as the rate is increased. If, however, the most highly depleted layers themselves produce at high ratios because of high free gas saturations, the overall GOR will eventually start to rise as the rate is increased and this climb will be continued (after the most permeable zone has come onto production). Thus, it is to be expected that a well producing from a stratified formation will exhibit a minimum GOR as the rate of production is increased. One of the major concerns in a multiplayer system is that interlayer cross-flow may occur if reservoir fluids are produced from commingled layers that have unequal ini- tial pressures. This cross-flow greatly affects the composite IPR of the well, which may result in an optimistic estimate of production rate from the commingled layers. El-Banbi and Wattenbarger (1996, 1997) investigated productivity of commingled gas reservoirs based on history matching to production data. However, no information was given in the papers regarding generation of IPR curves. 3.5.1 Composite IPR Models The following assumptions are made in this section: 1. Pseudo–steady-state flow prevails in all the reservoir layers. 2. Fluids from/into all the layers have similar properties. 3. Pressure losses in the wellbore sections between layers are negligible (these pressure losses are considered in Chapter 6 where multilateral wells are addressed). 4. The IPR of individual layers is known. On the basis of Assumption 1, under steady-flow condi- tions, the principle of material balance dictates net mass flow rate from layers to the well ¼mass flow rate at well head or Xn i¼1riqi¼rwhqwh,( 3:36) where ri¼density of fluid from/into layer i, qi¼flow rate from/into layer i, rwh¼density of fluid at wellhead, qwh¼flow rate at wellhead, and n¼number of layers. Fluid flow from wellbore to reservoir is indicated by negative qi. Using Assumption2 andignoring densitychange from bottom hole to well head, Eq. (3.36) degenerates to Xn i¼1qi¼qwh (3:37) or Xn i¼1Ji(/C22p pi/C0pwf)¼qwh,( 3:38) where Jiis the productivity index of layer i. 3.5.1.1 Single-Phase Liquid Flow For reservoir layers containing undersaturated oils, if the flowing bottom-hole pressure is above the bubble-point pressures of oils in all the layers, single-phase flow in all the layers is expected. Then Eq. (3.38) becomes Xn i¼1J/C3 i(/C22p pi/C0pwf)¼qwh,( 3:39) where J/C3 iis the productivity index of layer iat and above the bubble-point pressure.

Although numerous equations have been proposed to estimate J/C3 ifor different types of wells, it is always recommended to determine J/C3 ibased on flow tests of individual layers. If the tested rate ( qi) was obtained at a wellbore pressure ( pwfi) that is greater than the bubble- point pressure in layer i, the productivity index J/C3 ican be determined by J/C3 i¼qi /C22p pi/C0pwfi: (3:48) If the tested rate ( qi) was obtained at a wellbore pressure (pwfi) that is less than the bubble-point pressure in layer i, the productivity index J/C3 ishould be determined by J/C3 i¼qi (/C22p pi/C0pbi)þpbi 1:81/C00:2pwfi pbi/C16/C17 /C00:8pwfi pbi/C16/C172/C20/C21 : (3:49) With J/C3 i,/C22p pi, and pbiknown, the composite IPR can be generated using Eq.

These oil layers were tested in six groups. Layers B4 and C2 were tested together and Layers D3 and D4 were tested together. Test data and calculated productivity index ( J/C3 i) are summarized in Table 3.1. The IPR curves of the individual layers are shown in Fig. 3.15. It is seen from this figure that productivities of Layers A4, A5, and B1 are significantly lower than those of other layers. It is expected that wellbore cross-flow should occur if the bottom pressure is above the lowest reservoir pressure of 2,254 psi. Layers B4, C1, and C2 should be the major thief zones because of their high injectivities (assum- ing to be equal to their productivities) and relatively low pressures. The composite IPR of these layers is shown in Fig. 3.16 where the net production rate from the well is plotted against bottom-hole pressure. It is seen from this figure that net oil production will not be available unless the bottom-hole pressure is reduced to below 2,658 psi. Figure 3.15 suggests that the eight oil layers be produced separately in three layer groups: Group 1: Layers D3 and D4 Group 2: Layers B4, C1, and C2 Group 3: Layers B1, A4 and A5 The composite IPR for Group 1 (D3 and D4) is the same as shown in Fig. 3.15 because these two layers were the commingle-tested. Composite IPRs of Group 2 andGroup 3 are plotted in Figs. 3.17 and 3.18. Table 3.2 compares production rates read from Figs. 3.16, 3.17, and 3.18 at some pressures. This comparison indicates that significant production from Group 1 can be achieved at bottom-hole pressures higher than 2658 psi, while Group 2 and Group 3 are shut-in. A significant production from Group 1 and Group 2 can be achieved at bottom- hole pressures higher than 2,625 psi while Group 3 is shut- in. The grouped-layer production will remain beneficial until bottom-hole pressure is dropped to below 2,335 psi where Group 3 can be open for production. 3.6 Future IPR Reservoir deliverability declines with time. During transi- ent flow period in single-phase reservoirs, this decline is because the radius of the pressure funnel, over which the pressure drawdown ( pi/C0pwf) acts, increases with time, i.e., the overall pressure gradient in the reservoir drops with time. In two-phase reservoirs, as reservoir pressure depletes, reservoir deliverability drops due to reduced rela- tive permeability to oil and increased oil viscosity. Future IPR can be predicted by both Vogel’s method and Fetko- vich’s method. 3.6.1 Vogel’s Method LetJ/C3 pandJ/C3 fbe the present productivity index and future productivity index, respectively.

The simplest two-phase flow case is that of constant pressure peat the outer boundary ( re), with peless than the bubble-point pressure so that there is two-phase flow throughout the reservoir. Under these circumstances, f(p) takes on the valuekro moBo, where krois the relative permeability to oil at the satura- tion conditions in the formation corresponding to the pressure p. In this method, Fetkovich makes the key as- sumption that to a good degree of approximation, the expressionkro moBois a linear function of p, and is a straight line passing through the origin. If piis the initial formation pressure (i.e., /C24pe), then the straight-line assumption is kro moBo¼kro moBo/C18/C19p pi: (3:54) Substituting Eq. (3.54) into Eq. (3.53) and integrating the latter givesqo¼0:007082 kh lnre rw/C18/C19kro moBo/C18/C19 i1 2pi(p2 i/C0p2 wf)( 3:55) or qo¼J0 i(p2 i/C0p2 wf), (3 :56) where J0 i¼0:007082 kh lnre rw/C18/C19kro moBo/C18/C19 i1 2pi: (3:57) The derivative of Eq. (3.45) with respect to the flowing bottom-hole pressure is dqo dpwf¼/C02J0 ipwf: (3:58) This implies that the rate of change of qwith respect to pwf is lower at the lower values of the inflow pressure. Next, we can modify Eq. (3.58) to take into account that in practice peis not constant but decreases as cumulative production increases. The assumption made is that J0 iwill decrease in proportion to the decrease in average reservoir (drainage area) pressure. Thus, when the static pressure is pe(<pi), the IPR equation is qo¼J0 ipe pi(p2 e/C0p2 wf)( 3:59) or, alternatively, qo¼J0(p2 e/C0p2 wf), (3 :60) where J0¼J0 ipe pi: (3:61) These equations may be used to extrapolate into the future.

Summary This chapter presented and illustrated various mathemat- ical models for estimating deliverability of oil and gas reservoirs. Production engineers should make selections of the models based on the best estimate of his/her reser- voir conditions, that is, flow regime and pressure level. The selected models should be validated with actual well pro- duction rate and bottom-hole pressure. At least one test point is required to validate a straight-line (single-liquid flow) IPR model. At least two test points are required to validate a curvic (single-gas flow or two-phase flow) IPR model.References bandakhlia, h. andaziz, k.

However, the achievable oil production rate from a well is determined by wellhead pressure and the flow performance of production string, that is, tubing, casing, or both. The flow perform- ance of production string depends on geometries of the production string and properties of fluids being produced. The fluids in oil wells include oil, water, gas, and sand. Wellbore performance analysis involves establishing a re- lationship between tubular size, wellhead and bottom-hole pressure, fluid properties, and fluid production rate. Understanding wellbore flow performance is vitally im- portant to production engineers for designing oil well equipment and optimizing well production conditions. Oil can be produced through tubing, casing, or both in an oil well depending on which flow path has better per- formance. Producing oil through tubing is a better option in most cases to take the advantage of gas-lift effect. The traditional term tubing performance relationship (TPR) is used in this book (other terms such as vertical lift perform- ance have been used in the literature). However, the math- ematical models are also valid for casing flow and casing- tubing annular flow as long as hydraulic diameter is used. This chapter focuses on determination of TPR and pres- sure traverse along the well string. Both single-phase and multiphase fluids are considered. Calculation examples are illustrated with hand calculations and computer spread- sheets that are provided with this book. 4.2 Single-Phase Liquid Flow Single-phase liquid flow exists in an oil well only when the wellhead pressure is above the bubble-point pressure of the oil, which is usually not a reality. However, it is convenient to start from single-phase liquid for establishing the con- cept of fluid flow in oil wells where multiphase flow usually dominates. Consider a fluid flowing from point 1 to point 2 in a tubing string of length Land height /C1z(Fig. 4.1). The first law of thermodynamics yields the following equation for pressure drop: DP¼P1/C0P2¼g gcrDzþr 2gcDu2þ2fFru2L gcD(4:1) where /C1P¼pressure drop, lb f=ft2 P1¼pressure at point 1, lb f=ft2 P2¼pressure at point 2, lb f=ft2g¼gravitational acceleration, 32 :17 ft=s2 gc¼unit conversion factor, 32 :17 lb m-ft=lbf-s2 r¼fluid density lb m=ft3 /C1z¼elevation increase, ft u¼fluid velocity, ft/s fF¼Fanning friction factor L¼tubing length, ft D¼tubing inner diameter, ft The first, second, and third term in the right-hand side of the equation represent pressure drops due to changes in elevation, kinetic energy, and friction, respectively. The Fanning friction factor ( fF) can be evaluated based on Reynolds number and relative roughness. Reynolds num- ber is defined as the ratio of in ertial force to viscous force. The Reynolds number is expressed in consistent units as NRe¼Dur m(4:2) or in U.S. field units as NRe¼1:48qr dm(4:3) where NRe¼Reynolds number q¼fluid flow rate, bbl/day r¼fluid density lb m=ft3 d¼tubing inner diameter, in. m¼fluid viscosity, cp For laminar flow where NRe<2,000, the Fanning friction factor is inversely proportional to the Reynolds number, or fF¼16 NRe(4:4) For turbulent flow where NRe>2,100, the Fanning friction factor can be estimated using empirical cor- relations. Among numerous correlations developed by different investigators, Chen’s (1979) correlation has an explicit form and gives similar accuracy to the Cole- brook–White equation (Gregory and Fogarasi, 1985) that was used for generating the friction factor chart used in the petroleum industry. Chen’s correlation takes the following form: 1ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ fFp¼/C04/C2log« 3:7065/C05:0452 NRelog«1:1098 2:8257þ7:149 NRe/C18/C190:8981\"# () (4:5) where the relative roughness is defined as «¼d d, and dis the absolute roughness of pipe wall. The Fanning friction factor can also be obtained based on Darcy–Wiesbach friction factor shown in Fig. 4.2. The Darcy–Wiesbach friction factor is also referred to as the Moody friction factor (fM) in some literatures. The rela- tion between the Moody and the Fanning friction factor is expressed as fF¼fM 4: (4:6) Example Problem 4.1 Suppose that 1,000 bbl/day of 408API, 1.2 cp oil is being produced through 27⁄8-in., 8:6-lb m=ft tubing in a well that is 15 degrees from vertical.

These wells are called multiphase-oil wells . The TPR equation for single- phase flow is not valid for multiphase oil wells. To analyze TPR of multiphase oil wells rigorously, a multiphase flow model is required. Multiphase flow is much more complicated than single- phase flow because of the variation of flow regime (or flow pattern). Fluid distribution changes greatly in different flow regimes, which significantly affects pressure gradient in the tubing. 4.3.1 Flow Regimes As shown in Fig. 4.3, at least four flow regimes have been identified in gas-liquid two-phase flow. They are bubble, slug, churn, and annular flow. These flow regimes occur as a progression with increasing gas flow rate for a given liquid flow rate. In bubble flow, gas phase is dispersed in the form of small bubbles in a continuous liquid phase. In slug flow, gas bubbles coalesce into larger bubbles that eventually fill the entire pipe cross-section. Between the large bubbles are slugs of liquid that contain smaller bub- bles of entrained gas. In churn flow, the larger gas bubbles become unstable and collapse, resulting in a highly turbu- lent flow pattern with both phases dispersed. In annular flow, gas becomes the continuous phase, with liquid flow- ing in an annulus, coating the surface of the pipe and with droplets entrained in the gas phase. 4.3.2 Liquid Holdup In multiphase flow, the amount of the pipe occupied by a phase is often different from its proportion of the total volumetric flow rate. This is due to density difference between phases. The density difference causes dense phase to slip down in an upward flow (i.e., the lighter phase moves faster than the denser phase). Because of this, the in situ volume fraction of the denser phase will be greater than the input volume fraction of the denser phase (i.e., the denser phase is ‘‘held up’’ in the pipe relative to the lighter phase). Thus, liquid ‘‘holdup’’ is defined as yL¼VL V,( 4:7) where yL¼liquid holdup, fraction VL¼volume of liquid phase in the pipe segment, ft3 V¼volume of the pipe segment, ft3Liquid holdup depends on flow regime, fluid proper- ties, and pipe size and configuration. Its value can be quantitatively determined only through experimental measurements. 4.3.3 TPR Models Numerous TPR models have been developed for analyzing multiphase flow in vertical pipes. Brown (1977) presents a thorough review of these models. TPR models for multi- phase flow wells fall into two categories: (1) homogeneous- flow models and (2) separated-flow models. Homogeneous models treat multiphase as a homogeneous mixture and do not consider the effects of liquid holdup (no-slip assump- tion). Therefore, these models are less accurate and are usually calibrated with local operating conditions in field applications. The major advantage of these models comes from their mechanistic nature. They can handle gas-oil- water three-phase and gas-oil-water-sand four-phase sys- tems. It is easy to code these mechanistic models in com- puter programs. Separated-flow models are more realistic than the homogeneous-flow models. They are usually given in the form of empirical correlations. The effects of liquid holdup (slip) and flow regime are considered. The major disad- vantage of the separated flow models is that it is difficult to code them in computer programs because most cor- relations are presented in graphic form. 4.3.3.1 Homogeneous-Flow Models Numerous homogeneous-flow models have been devel- oped for analyzing the TPR of multiphase wells since the pioneering works of Poettmann and Carpenter (1952). Poettmann–Carpenter’s model uses empirical two-phase friction factor for friction pressure loss calculations with- out considering the effect of liquid viscosity. The effect of liquid viscosity was considered by later researchers including Cicchitti (1960) and Dukler et al. (1964). A comprehensive review of these models was given by Hasan and Kabir (2002). Guo and Ghalambor (2005) presented work addressing gas-oil-water-sand four-phase flow. Assuming no slip of liquid phase, Poettmann and Car- penter (1952) presented a simplified gas-oil-water three- phase flow model to compute pressure losses in wellbores by estimating mixture density and friction factor. Accord- ing to Poettmann and Carpenter, the following equation can be used to calculate pressure traverse in a vertical tubing when the acceleration term is neglected: Dp¼/C22r rþ/C22k k /C22r r/C18/C19Dh 144(4:8) where Dp¼pressure increment, psi /C22r r¼average mixture density (specific weight), lb =ft3 Dh¼depth increment, ft and /C22k k¼f2Fq2 oM2 7:4137 /C21010D5(4:9) where f2F¼Fanning friction factor for two-phase flow qo¼oil production rate, stb/day M¼total mass associated with 1 stb of oil D¼tubing inner diameter, ft The average mixture density /C22r rcan be calculated by /C22r r¼r1þr2 2(4:10)4/48 PETROLEUM PRODUCTION ENGINEERING FUNDAMENTALSwhere r1¼mixture density at top of tubing segment, lb =ft3 r2¼mixture density at bottom of segment, lb =ft3 The mixture density at a given point can be calculated based on mass flow rate and volume flow rate: r¼M Vm(4:11) where M¼350:17(goþWOR gw)þGORrairgg (4:12)Vm¼5:615(BoþWOR B w)þ(GOR /C0Rs)14:7 p/C18/C19T 520/C18/C19z 1:0/C16/C17 (4:13) and where go¼oil specific gravity, 1 for freshwater WOR ¼producing water–oil ratio, bbl/stb gw¼water-specific gravity, 1 for freshwater GOR ¼producing gas–oil ratio, scf/stb Flow Direction PO O 10 1.0 0.1 0.1 1.0 Superficial Gas Velocity, VSG, ft./sec.10 100HI J K L MN G F E D C B ARSuperficial Water Velocity, VSL, ft./sec.Annular Mist (Water dispersed) Froth (Both phasesdispersed)Slug 4 (Air dispersed)Bubble (Air dispersed) Figure 4.3 Flow regimes in gas-liquid flow (used, with permission, from Govier and Aziz, 1977).WELLBORE PERFORMANCE 4/49rair¼density of air, lb m=ft3 gg¼gas-specific gravity, 1 for air Vm¼volume of mixture associated with 1 stb of oil, ft3 Bo¼formation volume factor of oil, rb/stb Bw¼formation volume factor of water, rb/bbl Rs¼solution gas–oil ratio, scf/stb p¼in situ pressure, psia T¼in situ temperature, 8R z¼gas compressibility factor at pandT.

The two-phase friction factor f2Fcan be estimated from a chart recommended by Poettmann and Carpenter (1952). For easy coding in com- puter programs, Guo and Ghalambor (2002) developed the following correlation to represent the chart: f2F¼101:444/C02:5 log ( Drv),( 4:16) where ( Drv) is the numerator of Reynolds number repre- senting inertial force and can be formulated as (Drv)¼1:4737 /C210/C05Mq o D: (4:17) Because the Poettmann–Carpenter model takes a finite- difference form, this model is accurate for only short- depth incremental /C1h. For deep wells, this model should be used in a piecewise manner to get accurate results (i.e., the tubing string should be ‘‘broken’’ into small segments and the model is applied to each segment). Because iterations are required to solve Eq. (4.8) for pressure, a computer spreadsheet program Poettmann- CarpenterBHP.xls has been developed. The program is available from the attached CD. Example Problem 4.2 For the following given data, calculate bottom-hole pressure: Tubing head pressure: 500 psia Tubing head temperature: 100 8F Tubing inner diameter: 1.66 in. Tubing shoe depth (near bottom hole): 5,000 ft Bottom hole temperature: 150 8F Liquid production rate: 2,000 stb/day Water cut: 25% Producing GLR: 1,000 scf/stb Oil gravity: 30 8API Water specific gravity: 1.05 1 for freshwater Gas specific gravity: 0.65 1 for air Solution This problem can be solved using the computer program Poettmann-CarpenterBHP.xls . The result is shown in Table 4.1. The gas-oil-water-sand four-phase flow model proposed by Guo and Ghalambor (2005) is similar to the gas-oil- water three-phase flow model presented by Poettmann and Carpenter (1952) in the sense that no slip of liquid phase was assumed. But the Guo–Ghalambor model takes a closed (integrated) form, which makes it easyto use. The Guo–Ghalambor model can be expressed as follows: 144b(p/C0phf)þ1/C02bM 2ln(144pþM)2þN (144phfþM)2þN/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12 /C0Mþb cN/C0bM2 ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ Np /C2tan/C01144pþMﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ Np/C18/C19 /C0tan/C01144phfþMﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ Np/C18/C19 /C20/C21 ¼a( cosuþd2e)L,( 4:18) where the group parameters are defined as a¼0:0765ggqgþ350goqoþ350gwqwþ62:4gsqs 4:07Tavqg,( 4 :19) b¼5:615qoþ5:615qwþqs 4:07TavQg,( 4:20) c¼0:00678Tavqg A,( 4:21) d¼0:00166 A(5:615qoþ5:615qwþqs), (4 :22) e¼fM 2gDH,( 4:23) M¼cde cosuþd2e,( 4:24) N¼c2ecosu ( cosuþd2e)2,( 4:25) where A¼cross-sectional area of conduit, ft2 DH¼hydraulic diameter, ft fM¼Darcy–Wiesbach friction factor (Moody factor) g¼gravitational acceleration, 32 :17 ft=s2 L¼conduit length, ft p¼pressure, psia phf¼wellhead flowing pressure, psia qg¼gas production rate, scf/d qo¼oil production rate, bbl/d qs¼sand production rate, ft3=day qw¼water production rate, bbl/d Tav¼average temperature, 8R gg¼specific gravity of gas, air ¼1 go¼specific gravity of produced oil, freshwater ¼1 gs¼specific gravity of produced solid, fresh water ¼1 gw¼specific gravity of produced water, fresh water ¼1 The Darcy–Wiesbach friction factor ( fM) can be obtained from diagram (Fig. 4.2) or based on Fanning friction factor ( fF) obtained from Eq.

The result is shown in Table 4.2. 4.3.3.2 Separated-Flow Models A number of separated-flow models are available for TPR calculations. Among many others are the Lockhart and Martinelli correlation (1949), the Duns and Ros correla- tion (1963), and the Hagedorn and Brown method (1965).Based on comprehensive comparisons of these models, Ansari et al. (1994) and Hasan and Kabir (2002) recom- mended the Hagedorn–Brown method with modifications for near-vertical flow. The modified Hagedorn–Brown (mH-B) method is an empirical correlation developed on the basis of the original work of Hagedorn and Brown (1965). The modifications include using the no-slip liquid holdup when the original correlation predicts a liquid holdup value less than the no- slip holdup and using the Griffith correlation (Griffith and Wallis, 1961) for the bubble flow regime. The original Hagedorn–Brown correlation takes the fol- lowing form: dP dz¼g gc/C22r rþ2fF/C22r ru2 m gcDþ/C22r rD(u2 m) 2gcDz,( 4:26) which can be expressed in U.S. field units as 144dp dz¼/C22r rþfFM2 t 7:413/C21010D5/C22r rþ/C22r rD(u2 m) 2gcDz,( 4:27) where Mt¼total mass flow rate, lb m=d /C22r r¼in situ average density, lb m=ft3Total measured depth: 7,000 ft The average inclination angle: 20 deg Tubing inner diameter: 1.995 in.

Obviously, determination of the value of liquid holdup yLis essential for pressure calculations.

Finally, the liquid holdup can be calculated by yL¼cyL c/C18/C19 : (4:41) The Fanning friction factor in Eq. (4.27) can be deter- mined using either Chen’s correlation Eq. (4.5) or (4.16).

Example Problem 4.4 For the data given below, calculate and plot pressure traverse in the tubing string: Solution This example problem is solved with the spreadsheet program HagedornBrownCorrelation.xls . The result is shown in Table 4.3 and Fig. 4.4. 4.4 Single-Phase Gas Flow The first law of thermodynamics (conservation of energy) governs gas flow in tubing. The effect of kinetic energy change is negligible because the variation in tubing diam- eter is insignificant in most gas wells. With no shaft work device installed along the tubing string, the first law of thermodynamics yields the following mechanical balance equation: dP rþg gcdZþfMn2dL 2gcDi¼0( 4:49) Because dZ¼cosudL,r¼29ggP ZRT, and n¼4qsczPscT pD2 iTscP, Eq.

Although the temperature Tcan be approximately expressed as a linear function of length L through geothermal gradient, the compressibility factor z is a function of pressure Pand temperature T. This makes it difficult to solve the equation analytically. Fortunately, the pressure Pat length Lis not a strong function of temperature and compressibility factor. Approximate so- lutions to Eq.

How- ever, if one assumes fully turbulent flow, which is the case for most gas wells, then a simple empirical relation may be used for typical tubing strings (Katz and Lee 1990): fM¼0:01750 d0:224 ifordi#4:277 in : (4:56) fM¼0:01603 d0:164 ifordi>4:277 in : (4:57) Guo (2001) used the following Nikuradse friction factor correlation for fully turbulent flow in rough pipes: fM¼1 1:74/C02 log2« di/C16/C172 43 52 (4:58) Because the average compressibility factor is a function of pressure itself, a numerical technique such as Newton– Raphson iteration is required to solve Eq.

Users need to input parameter values in the Input data section and run Macro Solution to get results.

At tubing head, the pressure is 800 psia and the temperature is 150 8F; the bottom-hole temperature is 200 8F. The relative roughness of tubing is about 0.0006.

These liquids are formation water and/ or gas condensate (light oil). Depending on pressure and temperature, in some wells, gas condensate is not seen at surface, but it exists in the wellbore. Some gas wells pro- duce sand and coal particles. These wells are called multi- phase-gas wells . The four-phase flow model in Section 4.3.3.1 can be applied to mist flow in gas wells. Summary This chapter presented and illustrated different mathemat- ical models for describing wellbore/tubing performance. Among many models, the mH-B model has been found to give results with good accuracy.

Two types of well- head chokes are used. They are (1) positive (fixed) chokes and (2) adjustable chokes. Placing a choke at the wellhead means fixing the well- head pressure and, thus, the flowing bottom-hole pressure and production rate. For a given wellhead pressure, by calculating pressure loss in the tubing the flowing bottom- hole pressure can be determined. If the reservoir pressure and productivity index is known, the flow rate can then be determined on the basis of inflow performance relation- ship (IPR). 5.2 Sonic and Subsonic Flow Pressure drop across well chokes is usually very significant. There is no universal equation for predicting pressure drop across the chokes for all types of production fluids. Differ- ent choke flow models are available from the literature, and they have to be chosen based on the gas fraction in the fluid and flow regimes, that is, subsonic or sonic flow. Both sound wave and pressure wave are mechanical waves. When the fluid flow velocity in a choke reaches the traveling velocity of sound in the fluid under the in situ condition, the flow is called ‘‘sonic flow.’’ Under sonic flow conditions, the pressure wave downstream of the choke cannot go upstream through the choke because the medium (fluid) is traveling in the opposite direction at the same velocity. Therefore, a pressure discontinuity exists at the choke, that is, the downstream pressure does not affect the upstream pressure. Because of the pressure discontinu- ity at the choke, any change in the downstream pressure cannot be detected from the upstream pressure gauge. Of course, any change in the upstream pressure cannot be detected from the downstream pressure gauge either. This sonic flow provides a unique choke feature that stabilizes well production rate and separation operation conditions. Whether a sonic flow exists at a choke depends on a downstream-to-upstream pressure ratio. If this pressure ratio is less than a critical pressure ratio, sonic (critical) flow exists. If this pressure ratio is greater than or equal to the critical pressure ratio, subsonic (subcritical) flow exists. The critical pressure ratio through chokes is expressed as poutlet pup/C18/C19 c¼2 kþ1/C18/C19 k k/C01 ,( 5:1) where poutlet is the pressure at choke outlet, pupis the upstream pressure, and k¼Cp=Cvis the specific heat ratio. The value of the kis about 1.28 for natural gas. Thus, the critical pressure ratio is about 0.55 for natural gas. A similar constant is used for oil flow. A typical choke performance curve is shown in Fig. 5.1. 5.3 Single-Phase Liquid Flow When the pressure drop across a choke is due to kinetic energy change, for single-phase liquid flow, the second term in the right-hand side of Eq. (4.1) can be rearranged as q¼CDAﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 2gcDP rs ,( 5:2) where q¼flow rate, ft3=s CD¼choke discharge coefficient A¼choke area, ft2 gc¼unit conversion factor, 32.17 lb m-ft=lbf-s2/C1P¼pressure drop, lb f=ft2 r¼fluid density, lb m=ft3 If U.S. field units are used, Eq.

NRe¼Reynolds number based on d2 5.4 Single-Phase Gas Flow Pressure equations for gas flow through a choke are derived based on an isentropic process. This is because there is no time for heat to transfer (adiabatic) and the friction loss is negligible (assuming reversible) at chokes. In addition to the concern of pressure drop across the chokes, temperature drop associated with choke flow is also an important issue for gas wells, because hydrates may form that may plug flow lines.0 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.20.10.20.3 p2/p1qq Critical Sub- criticalp1 p2d1 d2 Figure 5.1 A typical choke performance curve.5/60 PETROLEUM PRODUCTION ENGINEERING FUNDAMENTALS5.4.1 Subsonic Flow Under subsonic flow conditions, gas passage through a choke can be expressed as qsc¼1,248 CDA2pup /C2ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ k (k/C01)ggTuppdn pup/C18/C19 2 k /C0pdn pup/C18/C19 kþ1 k\"#vuut,( 5:5) where qsc¼gas flow rate, Mscf/d pup¼upstream pressure at choke, psia A2¼cross-sectional area of choke, in :2 Tup¼upstream temperature, 8R g¼acceleration of gravity, 32 :2f t=s2 gg¼gas-specific gravity related to airThe Reynolds number for determining CDis expressed as NRe¼20qscgg md2,( 5:6) where mis gas viscosity in cp.

This low temperature is due to the Joule–Thomson cooling effect, that is, a sudden gas expansion below the nozzle causes a significant temperature drop. The temperature can easily drop to below ice point, resulting in ice-plugging if water exists. Even though the temperature still can be above ice point, hydrates can form and cause plugging problems. Assuming an isentropic process for an ideal gas flowing through chokes, the temperature at the choke downstream can be predicted using the following equation: Tdn¼Tupzup zoutletpoutlet pup/C18/C19 k/C01 k (5:11) The outlet pressure is equal to the downstream pressure in subsonic flow conditions. 5.4.4 Applications Equations (5.5) through (5.11) can be used for estimating .Downstream temperature .Gas passage rate at given upstream and downstream pressures .Upstream pressure at given downstream pressure and gas passage .Downstream pressure at given upstream pressure and gas passage To estimate the gas passage rate at given upstream and downstream pressures, the following procedure can be taken: Step 1: Calculate the critical pressure ratio with Eq.

Downstream pressure cannot be calculated on the basis of given upstream pressure and gas passage under sonic flow conditions, but it can be calculated under subsonic flow conditions. The following procedure can be followed: Step 1: Calculate the critical pressure ratio with Eq. (5.1). Step 2: Calculate the maximum downstream pressure for minimum sonic flow by multiplying the upstream pressure by the critical pressure ratio. Step 3: Calculate gas flow rate at the minimum sonic flow condition with Eq. (5.8). Step 4: If the given gas passage is less than the calculated gas flow rate at the minimum sonic flow condi- tion, use Eq. (5.5) to solve downstream pressure numerically. Otherwise, the downstream pressure cannot be calculated. The maximum possible downstream pressure for sonic flow can be esti- mated by multiplying the upstream pressure by the critical pressure ratio.Example Problem 5.4 For the following given data, estimate downstream pressure at choke: Solution Example Problem 5.4 is solved with the spreadsheet program GasDownChokePressure.xls . The result is shown in Table 5.2. 5.5 Multiphase Flow When the produced oil reaches the wellhead choke, the wellhead pressure is usually below the bubble-point pres- sure of the oil. This means that free gas exists in the fluid stream flowing through choke. Choke behaves differently depending on gas content and flow regime (sonic or subsonic flow). 5.5.1 Critical (Sonic) Flow Tangren et al. (1949) performed the first investigation on gas-liquid two-phase flowthrough restrictions. They pre- sented an analysis of the behavior of an expanding gas- liquid system. They showed that when gas bubbles are added to an incompressible fluid, above a critical flow velocity, the medium becomes incapable of transmitting pressure change upstream against the flow.

On the basis of the production data from Ten Section Field in California, Gilbert (1954) found the values forC,m, and nto be 10, 0.546, and 1.89, respectively. Other values for the constants were proposed by different researchers including Baxendell (1957), Ros (1960), Achong (1961), and Pilehvari (1980). A summary of these values is presented in Table 5.3. Poettmann and Beck (1963) extended the work of Ros (1960) to develop charts for different API crude oils. Omana (1969) derived dimen- sionless choke correlations for water-gas systems.5.5.2 Subcritical (Subsonic) Flow Mathematical modeling of subsonic flow of multiphase fluid through choke has been controversial over decades. Fortunati (1972) was the first investigator who presented a model that can be used to calculate critical and subcritical two-phase flow through chokes. Ashford (1974) also developed a relation for two-phase critical flow based on the work of Ros (1960). Gould (1974) plotted the critical– subcritical boundary defined by Ashford, showing that different values of the polytropic exponents yield different boundaries. Ashford and Pierce (1975) derived an equa- tion to predict the critical pressure ratio. Their model assumes that the derivative of flow rate with respect to the downstream pressure is zero at critical conditions. One set of equations was recommended for both critical and subcritical flow conditions. Pilehvari (1980, 1981) also studied choke flow under subcritical conditions. Sachdeva (1986) extended the work of Ashford and Pierce (1975) and proposed a relationship to predict critical pressure ratio. He also derived an expression to find the boundary between critical and subcritical flow. Surbey et al. (1988, 1989) discussed the application of multiple orifice valve chokes for both critical and subcritical flow conditions. Empirical relations were developed for gas and water sys- tems. Al-Attar and Abdul-Majeed (1988) made a compari- son of existing choke flow models. The comparison was based on data from 155 well tests. They indicated that the best overall comparison was obtained with the Gilbert cor- relation, which predicted measured production rate within an average error of 6.19%. On the basis of energy equation, Perkins (1990) derived equations that describe isentropic flow of multiphase mixtures through chokes. Osman and Dokla (1990) applied the least-square method to field data to develop empirical correlations for gas condensate choke flow. Gilbert-type relationships were generated. Applica- tions of these choke flow models can be found elsewhere (Wallis, 1969; Perry, 1973; Brown and Beggs, 1977; Brill and Beggs, 1978; Ikoku, 1980; Nind, 1981; Bradley, 1987; Beggs, 1991; Rastion et al., 1992; Saberi, 1996). Sachdeva’s multiphase choke flow mode is representa- tive of most of these works and has been coded in some commercial network modeling software. This model uses the following equation to calculate the critical–subcritical boundary: yc¼k k/C01þ(1/C0x1)VL(1/C0yc) x1VG1 k k/C01þn 2þn(1/C0x1)VL x1VG2þn 2(1/C0x1)VL x1VG2hi28 >< >:9 >= >;k k/C01 ,( 5:13) where yc¼critical pressure ratio k¼Cp=Cv, specific heat ratio n¼polytropic exponent for gas x1¼free gas quality at upstream, mass fraction VL¼liquid specific volume at upstream, ft3=lbm VG1¼gas specific volume at upstream, ft3=lbm VG2¼gas specific volume at downstream, ft3=lbm. The polytropic exponent for gas is calculated using n¼1þx1(Cp/C0Cv) x1Cvþ(1/C0x1)CL: (5:14) The gas-specific volume at upstream ( VG1) can be deter- mined using the gas law based on upstream pressure and temperature. The gas-specific volume at downstream ( VG2) is expressed as VG2¼VG1y/C01 kc: (5:15) The critical pressure ratio yccan be solved from Eq. (5.13) numerically.Table 5.2 Solution Given by the Spreadsheet Program GasDownChokePressure.xls GasDownChokePressure.xls Description: This spreadsheet calculates upstream pressure at choke for dry gases.

Thus, x2¼x1can be as- sumed. Liquid volumetric flow rate can then be deter- mined based on liquid density. Gas mass flow rate is determined by MG2¼x2M2: (5:21) Gas volumetric flow rate at choke downstream can then be determined using gas law based on downstream pressure and temperature. The major drawback of Sachdeva’s multiphase choke flow model is that it requires free gas quality as an input parameter to determine flow regime and flow rates, and this parameter is usually not known before flow rates are known. A trial-and-error approach is, therefore, needed in flow rate computations. Table 5.4 shows an example cal- culation with Sachdeva’s choke model. Guo et al. (2002) investigated the applicability of Sachdeva’s choke flow model in southwest Louisiana gas condensate wells. A total of 512 data sets from wells in southwest Louisiana were gathered for this study. Out of these data sets, 239 sets were collected from oil wells and 273 from condensate wells. Each of the data sets includes choke size, gas rate, oil rate, condensate rate, water rate, gas–liquid ratio, up- stream and downstream pressures, oil API gravity, and gas deviation factor (z-factor). Liquid and gas flow rates from these wells were also calculated using Sachdeva’s choke model. The overall performance of the model was studied in predicting the gas flow rate from both oil and gas con- densate wells. Out of the 512 data sets, 48 sets failed to comply with the model. Mathematical errors occurred in finding square roots of negative numbers. These data sets were from the condensate wells where liquid densities ranged from 46.7 to 55 :1l b=ft3and recorded pressure dif- ferential across the choke less than 1,100 psi. Therefore, only 239 data sets from oil wells and 235 sets from conden- sate wells were used. The total number of data sets is 474. Different values of discharge coefficient CDwere used to improve the model performance. Based on the cases stud- ied, Guo et al. (2002) draw the following conclusions:Table 5.4 An Example Calculation with Sachdeva’s Choke Model Input data Choke diameter ( d2): 241⁄64in.

The accuracy of Sachdeva’s choke model can be im- proved by using different discharge coefficients for dif- ferent fluid types and well types. 2. For predicting liquid rates of oil wells and gas rates of gas condensate wells, a discharge coefficient of CD¼1:08 should be used. 3. A discharge coefficient CD¼0:78 should be used for predicting gas rates of oil wells. 4. A discharge coefficient CD¼1:53 should be used for predicting liquid rates of gas condensate wells. Summary This chapter presented and illustrated different mathemat- ical models for describing choke performance. While the choke models for gas flow have been well established with fairly good accuracy in general, the models for two-phase flow are subject to tuning to local oil properties. It is essential to validate two-phase flow choke models before they are used on a large scale.

Whereas the former describes the deliverability of the reservoir, the latter pre- sents the resistance to flow of production string. This chapter focuses on prediction of achievable fluid produc- tion rates from reservoirs with specified production string characteristics. The technique of analysis is called ‘‘Nodal analysis’’ (a Schlumburger patent). Calculation examples are illustrated with computer spreadsheets that are provided with this book. 6.2 Nodal Analysis Fluid properties change with the location-dependent pres- sure and temperature in the oil and gas production system. To simulate the fluid flow in the system, it is necessary to ‘‘break’’ the system into discrete nodes that separate sys- tem elements (equipment sections). Fluid properties at the elements are evaluated locally. The system analysis for determination of fluid production rate and pressure at a specified node is called ‘‘Nodal analysis’’ in petroleum engineering. Nodal analysis is performed on the principle of pressure continuity, that is, there is only one unique pressure value at a given node regardless of whether the pressure is evaluated from the performance of upstream equipment or downstream equipment. The performance curve (pressure–rate relation) of upstream equipment is called ‘‘inflow performance curve’’; the performance curve of downstream equipment is called ‘‘outflow per- formance curve.’’ The intersection of the two performance curves defines the operating point, that is, operating flow rate and pressure, at the specified node. For the conveni- ence of using pressure data measured normally at either the bottom-hole or the wellhead, Nodal analysis is usually conducted using the bottom-hole or wellhead as the solu- tion node. This chapter illustrates the principle of Nodal analysis with simplified tubing string geometries (i.e., single-diameter tubing strings). 6.2.1 Analysis with the Bottom-Hole Node When the bottom-hole is used as a solution node in Nodal analysis, the inflow performance is the well inflow per- formance relationship (IPR) and the outflow performance is the tubing performance relationship (TPR), if the tubing shoe is set to the top of the pay zone. Well IPR can be established with different methods presented in Chapter 3. TPR can be modeled with various approaches as discussed in Chapter 4. Traditionally, Nodal analysis at the bottom-hole is car- ried out by plotting the IPR and TPR curves and graph- ically finding the solution at the intersection point of the two curves. With modern computer technologies, the solution can be computed quickly without plotting the curves, although the curves are still plotted for visual verification. 6.2.1.1 Gas Well Consider the bottom-hole node of a gas well. If the IPR of the well is defined by qsc¼C(/C22p p2/C0p2 wf)n,( 6:1) and if the outflow performance relationship of the node (i.e., the TPR) is defined by p2 wf¼Exp(s)p2 hf þ6:67/C210/C04[Exp(s)/C01]fMq2 sc/C22z z2/C22T T2 d5 icosu,( 6:2)then the operating flow rate qscand pressure pwfat the bottom-hole node can be determined graphically by plot- ting Eqs. (6.1) and (6.2) and finding the intersection point. The operating point can also be solved analytically by combining Eqs. (6.1) and (6.2). In fact, Eq. (6.1) can be rearranged as p2 wf¼/C22p p2/C0qsc C/C16/C17 1 n: (6:3) Substituting Eq. (6.3) into Eq. (6.2) yields /C22p p2/C0qsc C/C16/C17 1 n/C0Exp(s)p2 hf /C06:67/C210/C04[Exp(s)/C01]fMq2 sc/C22z z2/C22T T2 D5 icosu¼0; (6:4) which can be solved with a numerical technique such as the Newton–Raphson iteration for gas flow rate qsc. This computation can be performed automatically with the spreadsheet program BottomHoleNodalGas.xls . Example Problem 6.1 Suppose that a vertical well produces 0.71 specific gravity gas through a 27⁄8-in. tubing set to the top of a gas reservoir at a depth of 10,000 ft. At tubing head, the pressure is 800 psia and the temperature is 150 8F, whereas the bottom-hole temperature is 200 8F. The relative roughness of tubing is about 0.0006. Calculate the expected gas production rate of the well using the following data for IPR: Reservoir pressure: 2,000 psia IPR model parameter C: 0.1 Mscf/d- psi2n IPR model parameter n: 0.8 Solution Example Problem 6.1 is solved with the spreadsheet program BottomHoleNodalGas.xls . Table 6.1 shows the appearance of the spreadsheet for the Input data and Result sections. It indicates that the expected gas flow rate is 1478 Mscf/d at a bottom-hole pressure of 1059 psia. The inflow and outflow performance curves plotted in Fig. 6.1 confirm this operating point. 6.2.1.2 Oil Well Consider the bottom-hole node of an oil well. As discussed in Chapter 3, depending on reservoir pressure range, dif- ferent IPR models can be used. For instance, if the reser- voir pressure is above the bubble-point pressure, a straight- line IPR can be used: q¼J/C3(/C22p p/C0pwf)( 6:5) The outflow performance relationship of the node (i.e., the TPR) can be described by a different model.

Figure 6.2 indicates that the expected gas flow rate is 2200 stb/d at a bottom-hole pressure of 3500 psia. 6.2.2 Analysis with Wellhead Node When the wellhead is used as a solution node in Nodal analysis, the inflow performance curve is the ‘‘wellheadperformance relationship’’ (WPR), which is obtained by transforming the IPR to wellhead through the TPR. The outflow performance curve is the wellhead choke performance relationship (CPR). Some TPR models are presented in Chapter 4. CPR models are discussed in Chapter 5. Nodal analysis with wellhead being a solution node is carried out by plotting the WPR and CPR curves and finding the solution at the intersection point of the two curves. Again, with modern computer technologies, the solu- tion can be computed quickly without plotting the curves, although the curves are still plotted for verification. 6.2.2.1 Gas Well If the IPR of a well is defined by Eq.

The inflow and outflow performance curves plotted in Fig. 6.3 confirm this operating point. 6.2.2.2 Oil Well As discussed in Chapter 3, depending on reservoir pressure range, different IPR models can be used.

(1996), several math- ematical models have been proposed to predict the deliver- ability of multilateral wells. Some of these models are found from Salas et al. (1996), Larsen (1996), and Chen et al. (2000). Some of these models are oversimplified and some others are too complex to use. Consider a multilateral well trajectory depicted in Fig. 6.6. Nomenclatures are illustrated in Fig. 6.7. Suppose the well has nlaterals and each lateral consists of three sections: horizontal, curvic, and vertical. Let Li,Ri, and Hidenote the length of the horizontal section, radius of curvature of the curvic section, and length of the vertical section of lateral i, respectively. Assuming the pressure losses in the horizontal sections are negligible, pseudo–steady IPR of the laterals can be expressed as follows: qi¼fLipwfi/C0/C1 i¼1, 2, ...,n,( 6:26) where qi¼production rate from lateral i fLi¼inflow performance function of the horizontal section of lateral ipwfi¼the average flowing bottom-lateral pressure in lateral i.

It should be noted that the composite IPR model described here is general. If the vertical section of the top lateral is the production string (production through tubing or/and casing), then phfnwill be the flowing wellhead pres- sure. In this case, the relation expression (Eq. [6.31]) rep- resents the WPR. 6.3.1 Gas well For gas wells, Eq.

Summary This chapter illustrated the principle of system analysis (Nodal analysis) with simplified well configurations. In the industry, the principle is applied with a piecewise approach to handle local flow path dimension, fluid prop- erties, and heat transfer to improve accuracy. It is vitally important to validate IPR and TPR models before performing Nodal analysis on a large scale. A Nodal analysis model is not considered to be reliable before it can match well production rates at two bottom- hole pressures.Table 6.10 Data Input and Result Sections of the Spreadsheet MultilateralOilWellDeliverability.xls MultilateralOilWellDeliverability.xls Instruction: (1) Update parameter values in the Input data section; (2) click Calculate button; and (3) view result.

Combined with information of oil and gas prices, the results of a produc- tion forecast can be used for field economics analyses. A production forecast is performed on the basis of principle of material balance. The remaining oil and gas in the reservoir determine future inflow performance relation- ship (IPR) and, therefore, production rates of wells. Production rates are predicted using IPR (see Chapter 3) and tubing performance relationship (TPR) (see Chapter 4) in the future times. Cumulative productions are predicted by integrations of future production rates. A complete production forecast should be carried out in different flow periods identified on the basis of flow regimes and drive mechanisms. For a volumetric oil reservoir, these periods include the following: .Transient flow period .Pseudo–steady one-phase flow period .Pseudo–steady two-phase flow period 7.2 Oil Production during Transient Flow Period The production rate during the transient flow period can be predicted by Nodal analysis using transient IPR and steady flow TPR. IPR model for oil wells is given by Eq. (3.2), that is, q¼kh(pi/C0pwf) 162:6Bomologtþlogk fmoctr2w/C03:23þ0:87S/C16/C17 :(7:1) Equation 7.1 can be used for generating IPR curves for future time tbefore any reservoir boundary is reached by the pressure wave from the wellbore. After all reservoir boundaries are reached, either pseudo–steady-state flow or steady-state flow should prevail depending on the types of reservoir boundaries. The time required for the pressure wave to reach a circular reservoir boundary can be with tpss/C251,200fmctr2 e k. The same TPR is usually used in the transient flow period assuming fluid properties remain the same in the well over the period. Depending on the producing gas–liquid ratio (GLR), the TPR model can be chosen from simple ones such as Poettmann–Carpenter and sophisticated ones such as the modified Hagedorn–Brown. It is essential to validate the selected TPR model based on measured data such as flow gradient survey from local wells. Example Problem 7.1 Suppose a reservoir can produce oil under transient flow for the next 6 months. Predict oil production rate and cumulative oil production over the 6 months using the following data:Solution To solve Example Problem 7.1, the spreadsheet program TransientProductionForecast.xls was used to perform Nodal analysis for each month. Operating points are shown in Fig. 7.1. The production forecast result is shown in Table 7.1, which also includes calculated cumulative production at the end of each month. The data in Table 7.1 are plotted in Fig. 7.2. 7.3 Oil Production during Pseudo–Steady Flow Period It is generally believed that oil production during a pseudo– steady-state flow period is due to fluid expansion in under- saturated oil reservoirs and solution-gas drive in saturated oil reservoirs. An undersaturated oil reservoir becomes a saturated oil reservoir when the reservoir pressure drops to below the oil bubble-point pressure. Single-phase flow dominates in undersaturated oil reservoirs and two-phase flow prevails in saturated oil reservoirs. Different math- ematical models have been used for time projection in production forecast for these two types of reservoirs, or the same reservoir at different stages of development based on reservoir pressure. IPR changes over time due to the changes in gas saturation and fluid properties. 7.3.1 Oil Production During Single-Phase Flow Period Following a transient flow period and a transition time, oil reservoirs continue to deliver oil through single-phase flow under a pseudo–steady-state flow condition. The IPR changes with time because of the decline in reservoir pres- sure, while the TPR may be considered constant because fluid properties do not significantly vary above the bubble- point pressure. The TPR model can be chosen from simple ones such as Poettmann–Carpenter and sophisticated ones such as the modified Hagedorn–Brown. The IPR model is given by Eq. (3.7), in Chapter 3, that is, q¼kh(/C22p p/C0pwf) 141:2Bomo1 2ln4A gCAr2wþS/C16/C17 : (7:2) The driving mechanism above the bubble-point pressure is essentially the oil expansion because oil is slightly compressible. The isothermal compressibility is defined as c¼/C01 V@V @p,( 7:3) where Vis the volume of reservoir fluid and pis pressure. The isothermal compressibility cis small and essentially constant for a given oil reservoir. The value of ccan be measured experimentally. By separating variables, integra- tion of Eq.

If the original oil in place Nis known, the cumulative recovery (cumulative production) is simply expressed as Np¼rN.

Example Problem 7.2 Suppose the reservoir described in Example Problem 7.1 begins to produce oil under pseudo– steady-state flow conditions immediately after the 6-month transient flow. If the bubble-point pressure is 4,500 psia, predict the oil production rate and cumulative oil production over the time interval before the reservoir pressure declines to bubble-point pressure. Solution Based on the transient flow IPR, Eq. (7.1), the productivity index will drop to 0.2195 stb/d-psi and production rate will drop to 583 stb/d at the end of the 6 months. If a pseudo–steady-state flow condition assumes immediately after the 6-month transient flow, the sameproduction rate should be given by the pseudo–steady-state flow IPR, Eq. (7.2). These conditions require that the average-reservoir pressure be 5,426 psia by /C22p p¼p/C035:3 eq/C22 khand drainage be 1458 acres by Eq. (3.9). Assuming an initial water saturation of 0.35, the original oil in place (OOIP) in the drainage area is estimated to be 87,656,581 stb. Using these additional data, Nodal analyses were per- formed with spreadsheet program Pseudo-Steady-1Phase ProductionForecast.xls at 10 average-reservoir pressures from 5,426 to bubble-point pressure of 4,500 psia. Operating points are shown in Fig. 7.3. The production forecast result is shown in Table 7.2. The production rate and cumulative production data in Table 7.2 are plotted in Fig. 7.4. 7.3.2 Oil Production during Two-Phase Flow Period Upon the average-reservoir pressure drops to bubble-point pressure, a significant amount of solution gas becomes free gas in the reservoir, and solution-gas drive becomes a dominating mechanism of fluid production. The gas–oil two-phase pseudo–steady-state flow begins to prevail the reservoir. Both IPR and TPR change with time because of the significant variations of fluid properties, relative per- meabilities, and gas–liquid ratio (GLR). The Hagedorn– Brown correlation should be used to model the TPR. The IPR can be described with Vogel’s model by Eq. (3.19), in Chapter 3, that is,05001,0001,5002,0002,5003,0003,5004,0004,5005,000 Production Rate (stb/day)Flowing Bottom Hole Pressure (psia)IPR for reservoir pressure 5,426 psia IPR for reservoir pressure 5,300 psia IPR for reservoir pressure 5,200 psia IPR for reservoir pressure 5,100 psia IPR for reservoir pressure 5,000 psia IPR for reservoir pressure 4,900 psia IPR for reservoir pressure 4,800 psia IPR for reservoir pressure 4,700 psia IPR for reservoir pressure 4,600 psia IPR for reservoir pressure 4,500 psia TPR 1,300 100 300 500 700 900 1,100 Figure 7.3 Nodal analysis plot for Example Problem 7.2.

The commonly used material balance model is found in Craft and Hawkins (1991), which was based on the original work of Tarner (1944). The following procedure is taken to carry out a produc- tion forecast during the two-phase flow period: Step 1: Assume a series of average-reservoir pressure p¯ values between the bubble-point pressure pband abandonment reservoir pressure pa. Step 2: Estimate fluid properties at each average-reservoir pressure, and calculate incremental cumulative production DNpand cumulative production Np within each average-reservoir pressure interval. Step 3: Perform Nodal analyses to estimate production rateqat each average-reservoir pressure. Step 4: Calculate production time Dtfor each average- reservoir pressure interval by Dt¼DNp=qand the cumulative production time by t¼PDt. Step 2 is further described in the following procedure: 1. Calculate coefficients FnandFgfor the two pressure values that define the pressure interval, and obtain average values /C22F Fnand /C22F Fgin the interval. The Fnand Fgare calculated using Fn¼Bo/C0RsBg (Bo/C0Boi)þ(Rsi/C0Rs)Bg,( 7:9) Fg¼Bg (Bo/C0Boi)þ(Rsi/C0Rs)Bg,( 7:10) where Bgshould be in rb/scf if Rsis in scf/stb. 2.

The former computes operating points and the latter performs material balance calculations. The results are shown in Tables 7 .3, 7.4, and 7.5. Production forecast curves are given in Fig. 7.5. 7.4 Gas Production during Transient Flow Period Similar to oil production, the gas production rate during a transient flow period can be predicted by Nodal analysis using transient IPR and steady-state flow TPR. The IPR model for gas wells is described in Chapter 3, that is, q¼kh½m(pi)/C0m(pwf)/C138 1638Tlogtþlogk fmoctr2w/C03:23þ0:87S/C16/C17 : (7:15) Equation (7.15) can be used for generating IPR curves for future time tbefore any reservoir boundary is ‘‘felt.’’ Afterall reservoir boundaries are reached, a pseudo–steady-state flow should prevail for a volumetric gas reservoir. For a circular reservoir, the time required for the pressure wave to reach the reservoir boundary can be estimated with tpss/C251200fmctr2 e k. The same TPR is usually used in the transient flow period assuming fluid properties remain the same in the well over the period. The average temperature– average z-factor method can be used for constructing TPR. 7.5 Gas Production during Pseudo–Steady-State Flow Period Gas production during pseudo–steady-state flow period is due to gas expansion. The IPR changes over time due to the change in reservoir pressure.

The gas production schedule can be established through the material balance equation, Gp¼Gi1/C0/C22p p z pi zi ! ,( 7:17) where GpandGiare the cumulative gas production and initial ‘‘gas in place,’’ respectively. If the gas production rate is predicted by Nodal analysis at a given reservoir pressure level and the cumulative gas production is estimated with Eq.

It uses empirical decline models that have little fundamental justifications. These models include the following: .Exponential decline (constant fractional decline) .Harmonic decline .Hyperbolic decline Although the hyperbolic decline model is more general, the other two models are degenerations of the hyperbolic decline model. These three models are related through the following relative decline rate equation (Arps, 1945): 1 qdq dt¼/C0bqd,( 8:1) where band dare empirical constants to be deter- mined based on production data. When d¼0, Eq. (8.1) degenerates to an exponential decline model, and when d¼1, Eq. (8.1) yields a harmonic decline model. When 0 <d<1, Eq. (8.1) derives a hyperbolic decline model. The decline models are applicable to both oil and gas wells. 8.2 Exponential Decline The relative decline rate and production rate decline equa- tions for the exponential decline model can be derived from volumetric reservoir model. Cumulative production expression is obtained by integrating the production rate decline equation. 8.2.1 Relative Decline Rate Consider an oil well drilled in a volumetric oil reservoir. Suppose the well’s production rate starts to decline when a critical (lowest permissible) bottom-hole pressure is reached. Under the pseudo–steady-state flow condition, the production rate at a given decline time tcan be expressed as q¼kh(/C22p pt/C0pc wf) 141:2B0mln0:472re rw/C16/C17 þshi ,( 8:2) where /C22p pt¼average reservoir pressure at decline time t, pc wf¼the critical bottom-hole pressure maintained during the production decline. The cumulative oil production of the well after the production decline time tcan be expressed as Np¼ðt 0kh(/C22p pt/C0pc wf) 141:2Bomln0:472re rw/C16/C17 þshi dt: (8:3) The cumulative oil production after the production de- cline upon decline time tcan also be evaluated based on the total reservoir compressibility: Np¼ctNi Bo(/C22p p0/C0/C22p pt), (8 :4) where ct¼total reservoir compressibility, Ni¼initial oil in place in the well drainage area, /C22p p0¼average reservoir pressure at decline time zero.

In practice, the following form of Eq. (8.15) is used: q¼qie/C0bt,( 8:16) where qiis the production rate at t¼0. It can be shown thatq2 q1¼q3 q2¼...... ¼qn qn/C01¼e/C0b. That is, the fractional decline is constant for exponential decline. As an exercise, this is left to the reader to prove. 8.2.3 Cumulative production Integration of Eq.

If production rate and time data are available, the bvalue can be obtained based on the slope of the straight line on a semi-log plot. In fact, taking logarithm of Eq. (8.16) gives ln (q)¼ln (qi)/C0bt,( 8:20) which implies that the data should form a straight line with a slope of /C0bon the log( q) versus tplot, if exponential decline is the right model. Picking up any two points, (t1,q1) and ( t2,q2), on the straight line will allow analyt- ical determination of bvalue because ln (q1)¼ln (qi)/C0bt1 (8:21) and ln (q2)¼ln (qi)/C0bt2 (8:22) give b¼1 (t2/C0t1)lnq1 q2/C18/C19 : (8:23) If production rate and cumulative production data are available, the bvalue can be obtained based on the slope of the straight line on an Npversus qplot. In fact, rearranging Eq. (8.19) yields q¼qi/C0bNp: (8:24) Picking up any two points, ( Np1,q1) and ( Np2,q2), on the straight line will allow analytical determination of the b value because q1¼qi/C0bNp1 (8:25) and q2¼qi/C0bNp2 (8:26) give b¼q1/C0q2 Np2/C0Np1: (8:27) Depending on the unit of time t, the bcan have different units such as month/C01and year/C01. The following relation can be derived: ba¼12bm¼365bd,( 8:28) where ba,bm, and bdare annual, monthly, and daily decline rates, respectively. 8.2.5 Effective decline rate Because the exponential function is not easy to use in hand calculations, traditionally the effective decline rate has been used. Since e/C0x/C251/C0xfor small x-values based on Taylor’s expansion, e/C0b/C251/C0bholds true for small values ofb. The bis substituted by b’, the effective decline rate, in field applications. Thus, Eq. (8.16) becomes q¼qi(1/C0b0)t: (8:29) Again, it can be shown thatq2 q1¼q3 q2¼...... ¼qn qn/C01¼1/C0b0. Depending on the unit of time t, theb’can have different units such as month/C01and year/C01. The following relation can be derived: (1/C0b0 a)¼(1/C0b0 m)12¼(1/C0b0 d)365,( 8:30)where b0 a,b0 m, and b0 dare annual, monthly, and daily effective decline rates, respectively. Example Problem 8.1 Given that a well has declined from 100 stb/day to 96 stb/day during a 1-month period, use the exponential decline model to perform the following tasks: 1. Predict the production rate after 11 more months 2. Calculate the amount of oil produced during the first year 3. Project the yearly production for the well for the next 5 years Solution 1.

(8.1) yields differential equation for a harmonic decline model: 1 qdq dt¼/C0bq,( 8:31) which can be integrated as q¼q0 1þbt,( 8:32) where q0is the production rate at t¼0. Expression for the cumulative production is obtained by integration: Np¼ðt 0qdt, which gives Np¼q0 bln (1þbt): (8:33) Combining Eqs.

If the plot of log( q) versus tshows a straight line (Fig. 8.1), according to Eq. (8.20), the decline data follow an exponential decline model. If the plot of qversus Npshows a straight line (Fig. 8.2), according to Eq. (8.24), an exponential decline model should be adopted. If the plot of log( q) versus log( t) shows a straight line (Fig. 8.3), according to Eq. (8.32), theYearRate at End of Year (stb/day)Yearly Production (stb) 0 100.00 — 1 61.27 28,858 2 37.54 17,681 3 23.00 10,834 4 14.09 6,639 5 8.64 4,061 68,073q t Figure 8.1 A semilog plot of qversus tindicating an exponential decline. qNp Figure 8.2 A plot of Npversus qindicating an exponen- tial decline. q t Figure 8.3 A plot of log( q) versus log( t) indicating a harmonic decline.8/100 PETROLEUM PRODUCTION ENGINEERING FUNDAMENTALSdecline data follow a harmonic decline model. If the plot of Npversus log( q) shows a straight line (Fig. 8.4), according to Eq. (8.34), the harmonic decline model should be used. If no straight line is seen in these plots, the hyperbolicdecline model may be verified by plotting the relative decline rate defined by Eq. (8.1). Figure 8.5 shows such a plot. This work can be easily performed with computer program UcomS.exe . 8.6 Determination of Model Parameters Once a decline model is identified, the model parameters a andbcan be determined by fitting the data to the selected model. For the exponential decline model, the bvalue can be estimated on the basis of the slope of the straight line in the plot of log( q) versus t(Eq. [8.23]). The bvalue can also be determined based on the slope of the straight line in the plot of qversus Np(Eq. [8.27]). For the harmonic decline model, the bvalue can be estimated on the basis of the slope of the straight line in the plot of log( q) versus log( t) or Eq. (8.32): b¼q0 q1/C01 t1: (8:40) Thebvalue can also be estimated based on the slope of the straight line in the plot of Npversus log( q) (Eq. [8.34]). For the hyperbolic decline model, determination of a andbvalues is somewhat tedious. The procedure is shown in Fig. 8.6. Computer program UcomS.exe can be used for both model identification and model parameter determination, as well as production rate prediction. 8.7 Illustrative Examples Example Problem 8.2 For the data given in Table 8.1, identify a suitable decline model, determine model parameters, and project production rate until a marginal rate of 25 stb/day is reached.

Design and selection of the right equipment for production systems is essential for a production engineer to achieve his or her job objective. To perform their design work correctly, production engineers should have thorough knowledge of the principles and rules used in the industry for equipment design and selection. This part of the book provides graduating production engineers with principles and rules used in the petroleum production engineering practice. Materials are presented in the following three chapters: Chapter 9 Well Tubing 9/109 Chapter 10 Separation Systems 10/117 Chapter 11 Transportation Systems 11/1339Well Tubing Contents 9.1 Introduction 9/110 9.2 Strength of Tubing 9/110 9.3 Tubing Design 9/111 Summary 9/114 References 9/114 Problems 9/1149.1 Introduction Most oil wells produce reservoir fluids through tubing strings. This is mainly because tubing strings provide good sealing performance and allow the use of gas expan- sion to lift oil. Gas wells produce gas through tubing strings to reduce liquid loading problems. Tubing strings are designed considering tension, col- lapse, and burst loads under various well operating condi- tions to prevent loss of tubing string integrity including mechanical failure and deformation due to excessive stresses and buckling. This chapter presents properties of the American Petroleum Institute (API) tubing and special considerations in designing tubing strings. 9.2 Strength of Tubing The API defines ‘‘tubing size’’ using nominal diameter and weight (per foot). The nominal diameter is based on the internal diameter of tubing body. The weight of tubing determines the tubing outer diameter. Steel grades of tub- ing are designated to H-40, J-55, C-75, L-80, N-80, C-90, and P-105, where the digits represent the minimum yield strength in 1,000 psi. Table 9.1 gives the tensile requirements of API tubing. The minimum performance properties of API tubing are listed in Appendix B of this book. The tubing collapse strength data listed in Appendix B do not reflect the effect of biaxial stress. The effect of tension of the collapse resistance is analyzed as follows. Consider a simple uniaxial test of a metal specimen as shown in Fig. 9.1, Hooke’s Law applies to the elastic portion before yield point: s¼E«,( 9:1) where s,«, and Eare stress, strain, and Young’s modulus, respectively. The energy in the elastic portion of the test is Uu¼1 2s«¼1 2P ADl L¼1 2(P/C1Dl) V Uu¼1 2W V,( 9:2) where P,A,L,V, andDlare force, area, length, volume, and length change, respectively. However, using Hooke’s Law, we have Uu¼1 2s«¼1 2ss E/C16/C17 ¼1 2s2 E: (9:3) To assess whether a material is going to fail, we use various material failure criteria. One of the most import- ant is the Distortion Energy Criteria. This is for 3D and is U¼1 21þv 3E/C18/C19 ½s1/C0s2 ðÞ2þs2/C0s3 ðÞ2þs3/C0s1 ðÞ2/C138,( 9 :4)where n¼Poison’s ratio s1¼axial principal stress, psi s2¼tangential principal stress, psi s3¼radial principal stress, psi. For our case of the uniaxial test, we would have s1¼s s2¼0 s3¼0: (9:5) Then from Eq.

Forces affecting tubing strings in- clude the following: 1. Axial tension due to weight of tubing and compression due to buoyancy 2. External pressure (completion fluids, oil, gas, forma- tion water) 3. Internal pressure (oil, gas, formation water) 4. Bending forces in deviated portion of well 5. Forces due to lateral rock pressure 6. Other forces due to thermal gradient or dynamics 9.3.1 Tension, Collapse, and Burst Design The last three columns of the tables in Appendix B present tubing collapse resistance, internal yield pressure, and joint yield strength. These are the limiting strengths for a given tubing joint without considering the biaxial effect shown in Fig. 9.2. At any point should the net external pressure, net internal pressure, and buoyant tensile load not be allowed to exceed tubing’s axial load-corrected collapse resistance, internal yield pressure, and joint yield strength, respectively. Tubing strings should be designed to have strengths higher than the maximum expected loads with safety factors greater than unity. In addition, bending stress should be considered in tension design for deviated and horizontal wells. The tensile stress due to bending is expressed asCase 4 Case 2 Case 3 Case 1s2 s1 Figure 9.2 Effect of tension stress on tangential stress.WELL TUBING 9/111/C27b¼EDo 2Rc,( 9:20) where sb¼bending stress, psi E¼Young’s modulus, psi Rc¼radius of hole curvature, in.

Probably the best design practice is to consider the worst loading cases for collapse, burst, and tension loads that are possible for the well to experience during the life of the well. It is vitally important to check the remaining strengths of tubing in a subject well before any unexpected well treatment is carried out. Some special considerations in well operations that affect tubing string integrity are addressed in the sections that follow. 9.3.2 Buckling Prevention during Production A completion fluid is in place in the annular space between the tubing and the casing before a well is put into production. The temperature at depth is T¼TsfþGTD, where GTis geothermal gradient. When the oil is produced, the temperature in the tubing will rise. This will expand (thermal) the tubing length, and if there is not sufficient landing tension, the tubing will buckle. The temperature distribution in the tubing can be predicted on the basis of the work of Ramey (1962), Hasan and Kabir (2002), and Guo et al. (2005). The latter is described in Chapter 11. A conservative approach to temperature calculations is to assume the maximum possible tempera- ture in the tubing string with no heat loss to formation through annulus. Example Problem 9.2 Consider a 27⁄8in. API, 6.40 lb/ft Grade P-105 non-upset tubing anchored with a packer set at 10,000 ft. The crude oil production through the tubing from the bottom of the hole is 1,000 stb/day (no gas or water production). A completion fluid is in place in the annular space between the tubing and the casing (9.8 lb/ gal KCl water). Assuming surface temperature is 60 8F and geothermal gradient of 0.01 8F/ft, determine the landing tension to avoid buckling. Solution The temperature of the fluid at the bottom of the hole is estimated to be T10,000¼60þ0:01(10,000) ¼160/C14F: The average temperature of the tubing before oil produc- tion is Tav1¼60þ160 2¼110/C14F: The maximum possible average temperature of the tubing after oil production has started is Tav2¼160þ160 2¼160/C14F: This means that the approximate thermal expansion of the tubing in length will be DLT/C25bDTavg/C0/C1 L, where bis the coefficient of thermal expansion (for steel, this is bs¼0:0000065 per 8F). Thus, DLT/C250:0000065[160 /C0110]10,000 ¼3:25 ft: To counter the above thermal expansion, a landing tension must be placed on the tubing string that is equivalent to the above. Assuming the tubingis a simple uniaxial element,thenA/C25pt(D/C0t)¼p(0:217)(2 :875/C00:217)¼1:812 in :2 s¼E« F A¼E/C1DL L F¼AEDL L¼(1:812)(30 /C2106)(3:25) 10,000¼17,667 lb f: Thus, an additional tension of 17,667 lb fat the surface must be placed on the tubing string to counter the thermal expansion. It can be shown that turbulent flow will transfer heat efficiently to the steel wall and then to the completion fluid and then to the casing and out to the formation. While laminar flow will not transfer heat very efficiently to the steel then out to the formation. Thus, the laminar flow situations are the most likely to have higher temperature oil at the exit. Therefore, it is most likely the tubing will be hotter via simple conduction. This effect has been consid- ered in the work of Hasan and Kabir (2002). Obviously, in the case of laminar flow, landing tension beyond the buoy- ancy weight of the tubing may not be required, but in the case of turbulent flow, the landing tension beyond the buoyancy weight of the tubing is usually required to prevent buckling of tubing string. In general, it is good practice to calculate the buoyant force of the tubing and add approxi- mately 4,000- - -5,000 lb fof additional tension when landing. 9.3.3 Considerations for Well Treatment and Stimulation Tubing strings are designed to withstand the harsh conditions during wellbore treatment and stimulation operations such as hole cleaning, cement squeezing, gravel packing, frac-packing, acidizing, and hydraulic fracturing. Precautionary measures to take depend on tubing–packer relation. If the tubing string is set through a non-restrain- ing packer, the tubing is free to move. Then string buckling and tubing–packer integrity will be major concerns. If the tubing string is set on a restraining packer, the string is not free to move and it will apply force to the packer. The factors to be considered in tubing design include the following: .Tubing size, weight, and grade .Well conditions - Pressure effect - Temperature effect .Completion method - Cased hole - Open hole - Multitubing - Packer type (restraining, non-restraining) 9.3.3.1 Temperature Effect As discussed in Example Problem 9.2, if the tubing string is free to move, its thermal expansion is expressed as DLT¼bLDTavg: (9:21) If the tubing string is not free to move, its thermal expan- sion will generate force. Since Hook’s Law gives DLT¼LDF AE,( 9:22) substitution of Eq. (9.22) into Eq. (9.21) yields DF¼AEbDTavg/C25207ADTavg (9:23) for steel tubing. 9.3.3.2 Pressure Effect Pressures affect tubing string in different ways inclu- ding piston effect, ballooning effect, and buckling effect.9/112 EQUIPMENT DESIGN AND SELECTIONConsider the tubing–pack relation shown in Fig. 9.3. The total upward force acting on the tubing string from internal and external pressures is expressed as Fup¼pi(Ap/C0A0 i)þpo(Ao/C0A0 o), (9 :24) where pi¼pressure in the tubing, psi po¼pressure in the annulus, psi Ap¼inner area of packer, in :2 A0 i¼inner area of tubing sleeve, in :2 A0 o¼outer area of tubing sleeve, in :2 The total downward force acting on the tubing string is expressed as Fdown¼pi(Ai/C0A0 i)þpo(Ap/C0A0 o), (9 :25) where Aiis the inner area of tubing. The net upward force is then F¼Fup/C0Fdown¼pi(Ap/C0Ai)/C0po(Ap/C0Ao): (9:26) During a well treatment operation, the change (increase) in the net upward force is expressed as DF¼[Dpi(Ap/C0Ai)/C0Dpo(Ap/C0Ao)]: (9:27) If the tubing string is anchored to a restraining packer, this force will be transmitted to the packer, which may cause packer failure. If the tubing string is free to move, this force will cause the tubing string to shorten by DLP¼LDF AE,( 9:28) which represents tubing string shrinkage due to piston effect. As shown in Fig. 9.4a, the ballooning effect is due to the internal pressure being higher than the external pressure during a well treatment. The change in tensile force can be expressed as DFB¼0:6[Dpi avgAi/C0Dpo avgAo]: (9:29) If the tubing string is set through a restraining packer, this force will be transmitted to the packer, which may causepacker failure. If the tubing string is free to move, this force will cause the tubing string to shorten by DLB¼2L 108Dpi avg/C0R2Dpo avg R2/C01/C20/C21 ,( 9:30) where Dpi avg ¼the average pressure change in the tubing, psi Dpo avg ¼the average pressure change in the annulus, psi R2¼Ao=Ai: As illustrated in Fig. 9.4b, the buckling effect is caused by the internal pressure being higher than the external pres- sure during a well treatment. The tubing string buckles when FBK¼Ap(pi/C0po)>0. If the tubing end is set through a restraining packer, this force will be transmitted to the packer, which may cause packer failure. If the tubing string is not restrained at bottom, this force will cause the tubing string to shorten by DLBK¼r2F2 BK 8EIW,( 9:31) which holds true only if FBKis greater than 0, and r¼Dci/C0Di 2 I¼p 64(D4 o/C0D4 i) W¼WairþWfi/C0Wfo, where Dci¼inner diameter of casing, in.

A typical well stream is a turbulent mixture of oil, gas, water, and sometimes solid particles. The well stream should be pro- cessed as soon as possible after bringing it to the surface. Field separation processes fall into two categories: (1) separation of oil, water, and gas; and (2) dehydration that removes condensable water vapor and other undesirable compounds, such as hydrogen sulfide or carbon dioxide. This chapter focuses on the principles of separation and dehydration and selection of required separators and dehydrators. 10.2 Separation System Separation of well stream gas from free liquids is the first and most critical stage of field-processing operations. Composition of the fluid mixture and pressure determine what type and size of separator are required. Separators are also used in other locations such as upstream and downstream of compressors, dehydration units, and gas sweetening units. At these locations, separators are referred to as scrubbers, knockouts, and free liquid knock- outs. All these vessels are used for the same purpose: to separate free liquids from the gas stream. 10.2.1 Principles of Separation Separators work on the basis of gravity segregation and/or centrifugal segregation. A separator is normally con- structed in such a way that it has the following features: 1. It has a centrifugal inlet device where the primary sep- aration of the liquid and gas is made. 2. It provides a large settling section of sufficient height or length to allow liquid droplets to settle out of the gas stream with adequate surge room for slugs of liquid. 3. It is equipped with a mist extractor or eliminator near the gas outlet to coalesce small particles of liquid that do not settle out by gravity. 4. It allows adequate controls consisting of level control, liquid dump valve, gas backpressure valve, safety relief valve, pressure gauge, gauge glass, instrument gas regulator, and piping. The centrifugal inlet device makes the incoming stream spin around. Depending on the mixture flow rate, the reac- tion force from the separator wall can generate a centripetal acceleration of up to 500 times the gravitational acceler- ation. This action forces the liquid droplets together where they fall to the bottom of the separator into the settling section. The settling section in a separator allows the tur- bulence of the fluid stream to subside and the liquid drop- lets to fall to the bottom of the vessel due to gravity segregation. A large open space in the vessel is required for this purpose. Use of internal baffling or plates may produce more liquid to be discharged from the separator. However, the product may not be stable because of the light ends entrained in it. Sufficient surge room is essential in the settling section to handle slugs of liquid without carryover to the gas outlet. This can be achieved by placing the liquid level control in the separator, which in turn determines the liquid level. The amount of surge room required depends on the surge level of the production steam and the separator size used for a particular application. Small liquid droplets that do not settle out of the gas stream due to little gravity difference between them and the gas phase tend to be entrained and pass out of the separator with the gas. A mist eliminator or extractor near the gas outlet allows this to be almost eliminated. The small liquid droplets will hit the eliminator or extractor surfaces,coalesce, and collect to form larger droplets that will then drain back to the liquid section in the bottom of the sep- arator. A stainless steel woven-wire mesh mist eliminator can remove up to 99.9% of the entrained liquids from the gas stream. Cane mist eliminators can be used in areas where there is entrained solid material in the gas phase that may collect and plug a wire mesh mist eliminator. 10.2.2 Types of Separators Three types of separators are generally available from manufacturers: vertical, horizontal, and spherical separ- ators. Horizontal separators are further classified into two categories: single tube and double tube. Each type of separator has specific advantages and limitations. Selec- tion of separator type is based on several factors including characteristics of production steam to be treated, floor space availability at the facility site, transportation, and cost. 10.2.2.1 Vertical Separators Figure 10.1 shows a vertical separator. The inlet diverter baffle is a centrifugal inlet device making the incoming stream spin around. This action forces the liquid droplets to stay together and fall to the bottom of the separator along the separator wall due to gravity. Sufficient surge room is available in the settling section of the vertical separator to handle slugs of liquid without carryover to the gas outlet. A mist eliminator or extractor near the gas outlet allows the entrained liquid in the gas to be almost eliminated. Vertical separators are often used to treat low to inter- mediate gas–oil ratio well streams and streams with rela- tively large slugs of liquid. They handle greater slugs of liquid without carryover to the gas outlet, and the action of the liquid level control is not as critical. Vertical sep- arators occupy less floor space, which is important for facility sites such as those on offshore platforms where space is limited. Because of the large vertical distance between the liquid level and the gas outlet, the chance for liquid to revaporize into the gas phase is limited. However, because of the natural upward flow of gas in a vertical separator against the falling droplets of liquid, adequate separator diameter is required. Vertical separators are more costly to fabricate and ship in skid-mounted assemblies. 10.2.2.2 Horizontal Separators Figure 10.2 presents a sketch of a horizontal separator. In horizontal separators, gas flows horizontally while liquid droplets fall toward the liquid surface. The moisture gas flows in the baffle surface and forms a liquid film that is drained away to the liquid section of the separator. The baffles need to be longer than the distance of liquid trajec- tory travel. The liquid-level control placement is more critical in a horizontal separator than in a vertical sep- arator because of limited surge space. Horizontal separators are usually the first choice because of their low costs. They are almost widely used for high gas–oil ratio well streams, foaming well streams, or liquid-from-liquid separation. They have much greater gas–liquid interface because of a large, long, baffled gas- separation section. Horizontal separators are easier to skid-mount and service and require less piping for field connections. Individual separators can be stacked easily into stage-separation assemblies to minimize space re- quirements. Figure 10.3 demonstrates a horizontal double-tube sep- arator consisting of two tube sections. The upper tube section is filled with baffles, gas flows straight through and at higher velocities, and the incoming free liquid is immediately drained away from the upper tube10/118 EQUIPMENT DESIGN AND SELECTIONsection into the lower tube section. Horizontal double- tube separators have all the advantages of normal horizontal single-tube separators, plus much higher liquid capacities. Figure 10.4 illustrates a horizontal oil–gas–water three- phase separator. This type of separator is commonly used for well testing and in instances where free water readilyseparates from the oil or condensate. Three-phase sep- aration can be accomplished in any type of separator. This can be achieved by installing either special internal baffling to construct a water leg or water siphon arrange- ment. It can also be achieved by using an interface liquid- level control. In three-phase operations, two liquid dump valves are required.

Spherical separators offer an inexpensive and compact means of separation arrangement. Because of their compact config- urations, this type of separator has a very limited surge space and liquid settling section. Also, the placement and action of the liquid-level control in this type of separator is very critical. 10.2.3 Factors Affecting Separation Separation efficiency is dominated by separator size. For a given separator, factors that affect separation of liquid and gas phases include separator operating pressure, separator operating temperature, and fluid stream composition. Changes in any of these factors will change the amount of gas and liquid leaving the separator. An increase in operating pressure or a decrease in operating temperature generally increases the liquid covered in a separator. How- ever, this is often not true for gas condensate systems in which an optimum pressure may exist that yields the max- imum volume of liquid phase. Computer simulation (flash vaporization calculation) of phase behavior of the well stream allows the designer to find the optimum pressure and temperature at which a separator should operate to give maximum liquid recovery (see Chapter 18). However, it is often not practical to operate at the optimum point.This is because storage system vapor losses may become too great under these optimum conditions. In field separation facilities, operators tend to determine the optimum conditions for them to maximize revenue. As the liquid hydrocarbon product is generally worth more than the gas, high liquid recovery is often desirable, provided that it can be handled in the available storage system. The operator can control operating pressure to some extent by use of backpressure valves. However, pipe- line requirements for Btu content of the gas should also be considered as a factor affecting separator operation. It is usually unfeasible to try to lower the operating temperature of a separator without adding expensive mechanical refrigeration equipment. However, an indirect heater can be used to heat the gas before pressure reduc- tion to pipeline pressure in a choke. This is mostly applied to high-pressure wells. By carefully operating this indirect heater, the operator can prevent overheating the gas stream ahead of the choke. This adversely affects the temperature of the downstream separator. 10.2.4 Selection of Separators Petroleum engineers normally do not perform detailed designing of separators but carry out selection of sepa- rators suitable for their operations from manufacturers’ product catalogs. This section addresses how to determine Figure 10.3 A typical horizontal double-tube separator (courtesy Petroleum Extension Services).

Field experience has indicated that additional gas capacity can be obtained by increasing height of vertical separators and length of horizontal separators. The separator charts (Sivalls, 1977; Ikoku, 1984) give more realistic values for the gas capacity of separators. In addition, for single-tube horizontal ves- sels, corrections must be made for the amount of liquid in the bottom of the separator. Although one-half full of liquid is more or less standard for most single-tube hori- zontal separators, lowering the liquid level to increase the available gas space within the vessel can increase the gas capacity.

Adequate separation re- quires sufficient time to obtain an equilibrium condition between the liquid and gas phase at the temperature and pressure of separation. The liquid capacity of a separator relates to the retention time through the settling volume: qL¼1,440 VL t(10:4) where qL¼liquid capacity, bbl/day VL¼liquid settling volume, bbl t¼retention time, min Table10.2presents tvaluesfor various typesof separators tested in fields. It is shown that temperature has a strong impact on three-phase separations at low pressures. Tables 10.3 through 10.8 present liquid-settling volumes with the conventional placement of liquid-level controls for typical oil/gas separators. Proper sizing of a separator requires the use of both Eq. (10.3) for gas capacity and Eq. (10.4) for liquid capacity.Experience shows that for high-pressure separators used for treating high gas/oil ratio well streams, the gas capacity is usually the controlling factor for separator selection. However, the reverse may be true for low-pressure sep- arators used on well streams with low gas/oil ratios. Example Problem 10.1 Calculate the minimum required size of a standard oil/gas separator for the following conditions. Consider both vertical and horizontal separators. Gas flow rate: 5.0 MMscfd Gas-specific gravity: 0.7 Condensate flow rate: 20 bbl/MMscf Condensate gravity: 60 8API Operating pressure: 800 psia Operating temperature: 80 8F Solution The total required liquid flow capacity is (5)(20) ¼100 bbl/day.

This example illustrates a case of high gas/oil ratio well streams where the gas capacity is the controlling factor for separator selection. It suggests that a smaller horizontal separator would be required and would be more econom- ical. The selected separator should have at least a 1,000 psig working pressure. 10.2.5 Stage separation Stage separation is a process in which hydrocarbon mix- tures are separated into vapor and liquid phases by mul- tiple equilibrium flashes at consecutively lower pressures. A two-stage separation requires one separator and a stor- age tank, and a three-stage separation requires two sep- arators and a storage tank. The storage tank is always counted as the final stage of vapor/liquid separation. Stage separation reduces the pressure a little at a time, in steps or stages, resulting in a more stable stock-tank liquid. Usually a stable stock-tank liquid can be obtained by a stage separation of not more than four stages. In high-pressure gas-condensate separation systems, a stepwise reduction of the pressure on the liquid condensate can significantly increase the recovery of stock-tank liquids. Prediction of the performance of the various sep- arators in a multistage separation system can be carried out with compositional computer models using the initial well stream composition and the operating temperatures and pressures of the various stages. Although three to four stages of separation theoretically increase the liquid recovery over a two-stage separation, the incremental liquid recovery rarely pays out the cost of the additional separators. It has been generally recognized that two stages of separation plus the stock tank are practically optimum. The increase in liquid recovery for two-stage separation over single-stage separation usually varies from 2 to 12%, although 20 to 25% increases in liquid recoveries have been reported. The first-stage separator operating pressure is generally determined by the flowline pressure and operating charac- teristics of the well. The pressure usually ranges from 600 to 1,200 psi. In situations in which the flowline pres- sure is greater than 600 psi, it is practical to let the first- stage separator ride the line or operate at the flowline pressure. Pressures at low-stage separations can be deter- mined based on equal pressure ratios between the stages (Campbell, 1976): Rp¼p1 ps/C18/C19 1 Nst , (10:5)Table 10.6 Settling Volumes of Standard Horizontal Low-Pressure Separators (125 psi working pressure)(Continued ) VL(bbl) Size(D/C2L)1⁄2Full1⁄3Full1⁄4Full 3000/C2502.48 1.43 0.94 3000/C271=203.54 2.04 1.36 3000/C21004.59 2.66 1.77 3600/C21006.71 3.88 2.59 3600/C21509.76 5.66 3.79 4800/C210012.24 7.07 4.71 4800/C215017.72 10.26 6.85 6000/C210019.50 11.24 7.47 6000/C215028.06 16.23 10.82 6000/C220036.63 21.21 14.16 Table 10.7 Settling Volumes of Standard Spherical High-Pressure Separators (230–3,000 psi working pressure) Size(OD) VL(bbl) 24’’ 0.15 30’’ 0.30 36’’ 0.54 42’’ 0.88 48’’ 1.33 60’’ 2.20 Table 10.8 Settling Volumes of Standard Spherical Low-Pressure Separators (125 psi) Size(OD) VL(bbl) 41’’ 0.77 46’’ 1.02 54’’ 1.6010/124 EQUIPMENT DESIGN AND SELECTIONwhere Rp¼pressure ratio Nst¼number of stages /C01 p1¼first-stage or high-pressure separator pressure, psia ps¼stock-tank pressure, psia Pressures at the intermediate stages can then be designed with the following formula: pi¼pi/C01 Rp, (10:6) where pi¼pressure at stage i, psia. 10.3 Dehydration System All natural gas downstream from the separators still con- tain water vapor to some degree. Water vapor is probably the most common undesirable impurity found in the untreated natural gas. The main reason for removing water vapor from natural gas is that water vapor becomes liquid water under low-temperature and/or high-pressure conditions. Specifically, water content can affect long- distance transmission of natural gas because of the follow- ing facts: 1. Liquid water and natural gas can form hydrates that may plug the pipeline and other equipment. 2. Natural gas containing CO 2and/or H 2S is corrosive when liquid water is present. 3. Liquid water in a natural gas pipeline potentially causes slugging flow conditions resulting in lower flow effi- ciency of the pipeline. 4. Water content decreases the heating value of natural gas being transported. Dehydration systems are designed for further separating water vapor from natural gas before the gas is transported by pipeline. 10.3.1 Water Content of Natural Gas Streams Solubility of water in natural gas increases with tempera- ture and decreases with pressure. The presence of salt inthe liquid water reduces the water content of the gas. Water content of untreated natural gases is normally in the magnitude of a few hundred pounds of water per million standard cubic foot of gas (lb m=MMscf); while gas pipelines normally require water content to be in the range of 6- - -8 lb m=MMscf and even lower for offshore pipelines. The water content of natural gas is indirectly indicated by the ‘‘dew point,’’ defined as the temperature at which the natural gas is saturated with water vapor at a given pressure. At the dew point, natural gas is in equilibrium with liquid water; any decrease in temperature or increase in pressure will cause the water vapor to begin condensing. The difference between the dew point temperature of a water-saturated gas stream and the same stream after it has been dehydrated is called ‘‘dew-point depression.’’ It is essential to accurately estimate the saturated water vapor content of natural gas in the design and operation of dehydration equipment. Several methods are available for this purpose including the correlations of McCarthy et al. (1950) and McKetta and Wehe (1958). Dalton’s law of partial pressures is valid for estimating water vapor con- tent of gas at near-atmospheric pressures. Readings from the chart by McKetta and Wehe (1958) were re-plotted in Fig. 10.6 by Guo and Ghalambor (2005). Example Problem 10.2 Estimate water content of a natural gas at a pressure of 3,000 psia and temperature of 150 8F.

Further dehydration by absorp- tion or adsorption is often required. 10.3.2.1 Dehydration by Cooling The ability of natural gas to contain water vapor decreases as the temperature is lowered at constant pressure. During the cooling process, the excess water in the vapor state becomes liquid and is removed from the system. Natural gas containing less water vapor at low temperature is output from the cooling unit. The gas dehydrated by cooling is still at its water dew point unless the temperature is raised again or the pressure is decreased. Cooling for the purpose of gas dehydration is sometimes economical if the gas temperature is unusually high. It is often a good practice that cooling is used in conjunction with other dehydration processes. Gas compressors can be used partially as dehydrators. Because the saturation water content of gases decreases at higher pressure, some water is condensed and removed from gas at compressor stations by the compressor dis- charge coolers. Modern lean oil absorption gas plants use mechanical refrigeration to chill the inlet gas stream. Ethylene glycol is usually injected into the gas chilling section of the plant, which simultaneously dehydrates the gas and recovers liquid hydrocarbons, in a manner similar to the low-temperature separators. 10.3.2.2 Dehydration by Adsorption ‘‘Adsorption’’ is defined as the ability of a substance to hold gases or liquids on its surface. In adsorption dehy- dration, the water vapor from the gas is concentrated and held at the surface of the solid desiccant by forces caused by residual valiancy. Solid desiccants have very large sur- face areas per unit weight to take advantage of these surface forces. The most common solid adsorbents used today are silica, alumina, and certain silicates known as molecular sieves . Dehydration plants can remove practic- ally all water from natural gas using solid desiccants. Because of their great drying ability, solid desiccants are employed where higher efficiencies are required. Depicted in Fig. 10.7 is a typical solid desiccant dehy- dration plant. The incoming wet gas should be cleaned preferably by a filter separator to remove solid and liquidcontaminants in the gas. The filtered gas flows downward during dehydration through one adsorber containing a desiccant bed. The down-flow arrangement reduces dis- turbance of the bed caused by the high gas velocity during the adsorption. While one adsorber is dehydrating, the other adsorber is being regenerated by a hot stream of inlet gas from the regeneration gas heater. A direct-fired heater, hot oil, steam, or an indirect heater can supply the necessary regeneration heat. The regeneration gas usually flows upward through the bed to ensure thorough regen- eration of the bottom of the bed, which is the last area contacted by the gas being dehydrated. The hot regener- ated bed is cooled by shutting off or bypassing the heater. The cooling gas then flows downward through the bed so that any water adsorbed from the cooling gas will be at the top of the bed and will not be desorbed into the gas during the dehydration step. The still-hot regeneration gas and the cooling gas flow through the regeneration gas cooler to condense the desorbed water. Power-operated valves acti- vated by a timing device switch the adsorbers between the dehydration, regeneration, and cooling steps. Under normal operating conditions, the usable life of a desiccant ranges from 1 to 4 years. Solid desiccants become less effective in normal use because of loss of effective surface area as they age. Abnormally fast degradation occurs through blockage of the small pores and capillary openings lubricating oils, amines, glycols, corrosion inhibi- tors, and other contaminants, which cannot be removed during the regeneration cycle. Hydrogen sulfide can also damage the desiccant and reduce its capacity. The advantages of solid-desiccant dehydration include the following: .Lower dew point, essentially dry gas (water content <1.0 lb/MMcf) can be produced .Higher contact temperatures can be tolerated with some adsorbents .Higher tolerance to sudden load changes, especially on startup .Quick start up after a shutdown .High adaptability for recovery of certain liquid hydro- carbons in addition to dehydration functions Operating problems with the solid-desiccant dehydration include the following: Figure 10.7 Flow diagram of a typical solid desiccant dehydration plant (Guenther, 1979).10/126 EQUIPMENT DESIGN AND SELECTION.Space adsorbents degenerate with use and require replacement Dehydrating tower must be regenerated and cooled for operation before another tower approaches exhaustion. The maximum allowable time on dehydration gradually shortens because desiccant loses capacity with use. Although this type of dehydrator has high adaptability to sudden load changes, sudden pressure surges should be avoided because they may upset the desiccant bed and channel the gas stream resulting in poor dehydration. If a plant is operated above its rated capacity, high-pressure loss may introduce some attrition to occur. Attrition causes fines, which may in turn cause excessive pressure loss and result in loss of capacity. Replacing the desiccant should be scheduled and com- pleted ahead of the operating season. To maintain con- tinuous operation, this may require discarding the desiccant before its normal operating life is reached. To cut operating costs, the inlet part of the tower can be recharged and the remainder of the desiccant retained because it may still possess some useful life. Additional service life of the desiccant may be obtained if the direction of gas flow is reversed at a time when the tower would normally be recharged. 10.3.2.3 Dehydration by Absorption Water vapor is removed from the gas by intimate contact with a hygroscopic liquid desiccant in absorption dehydra- tion. The contacting is usually achieved in packed or trayed towers. Glycols have been widely used as effective liquid desiccants. Dehydration by absorption with glycol is usually economically more attractive than dehydration by solid desiccant when both processes are capable of meeting the required dew point. Glycols used for dehydrating natural gas are ethylene glycol (EG), diethylene glycol (DEG), triethylene glycol (TEG), and tetraethylene glycol (T 4EG). Normally a single type of pure glycol is used in a dehydrator, but sometimes a glycol blend is economically attractive. TEG has gained nearly universal acceptance as the most costeffective of the glycols because of its superior dew-point depression, operating cost, and operation reliability. TEG has been successfully used to dehydrate sweet and sour natural gases over wide ranges of operating conditions. Dew-point depression of 40–140 8F can be achieved at a gas pressure ranging from 25 to 2,500 psig and gas tem- perature between 40 and 160 8F. The dew-point depression obtained depends on the equilibrium dew-point tempera- ture for a given TEG concentration and contact tempera- ture. Increased glycol viscosity may cause problems at lower contact temperature. Thus, heating of the natural gas may be desirable. Very hot gas streams are often cooled before dehydration to prevent vaporization of TEG. The feeding-in gas must be cleaned to remove all liquid water and hydrocarbons, wax, sand, drilling muds, and other impurities. These substances can cause severe foam- ing, flooding, higher glycol losses, poor efficiency, and increased maintenance in the dehydration tower or ab- sorber. These impurities can be removed using an efficient scrubber, separator, or even a filter separator for very contaminated gases. Methanol, injected at the wellhead as hydrate inhibitor, can cause several problems for glycol dehydration plants. It increases the heat requirements of the glycol regeneration system. Slugs of liquid methanol can cause flooding in the absorber. Methanol vapor vented to the atmosphere with the water vapor from the regener- ation system is hazardous and should be recovered or vented at nonhazardous concentrations. 10.3.2.3.1 Glycol Dehydration Process Illustrated in Fig. 10.8 shows the process and flow through a typical glycol dehydrator. The dehydration process can be described as follows: 1. The feeding-in gas stream first enters the unit through an inlet gas scrubber to remove liquid accumulations. A two-phase inlet scrubber is normally required. 2. The wet gas is then introduced to the bottom of the glycol-gas contactor and allowed to flow upward through the trays, while glycol flows downward through the column. The gas contacts the glycol on Glycol −gas contactor Inlet scrubber Gas inlet Distillate outletGlycol cooler Glycol filterGas outlet Glycol pumpGlycol strainer Heat exchanger surge tankFlash separatorFuel gas scrubberVent gasFuel gas Stripping gasResoilerStripping stillWater vapor outlet Figure 10.8 Flow diagram of a typical glycol dehydrator (Sivalls, 1977).SEPARATION SYSTEMS 10/127each tray and the glycol absorbs the water vapor from the gas steam. 3. The gas then flows down through a vertical glycol cooler, usually fabricated in the form of a concentric pipe heat exchanger, where the outlet dry gas aids in cooling the hot regenerated glycol before it enters the contactor. The dry gas then leaves the unit from the bottom of the glycol cooler. 4. The dry glycol enters the top of the glycol-gas contactor from the glycol cooler and is injected onto the top tray. The glycol flows across each tray and down through a downcomer pipe onto the next tray. The bottom tray downcomer is fitted with a seal pot to hold a liquid seal on the trays. 5. The wet glycol, which has now absorbed the water vapor from the gas stream, leaves the bottom of the glycol-gas contactor column, passes through a high-pressure glycol filter, which removes any foreign solid particles that may have been picked up from the gas stream, and enters the power side of the glycol pump. 6. In the glycol pump, the wet high-pressure glycol from the contactor column pumps the dry regenerated glycol into the column. The wet glycol stream flows from the glycol pump to the flash separator, which allows for the release of the entrained solution gas. 7. The gas separated in the flash separator leaves the top of the flash separator vessel and can be used to supple- ment the fuel gas required for the reboiler. Any excess vent gas is discharged through a backpressure valve. The flash separator is equipped with a liquid level control and diaphragm motor valve that discharges the wet glycol stream through a heat exchange coil in the surge tank to preheat the wet glycol stream. 8. The wet glycol stream leaves the heat exchange coil in the surge tank and enters the stripping still mounted on top of the reboiler at the feed point in the still. The stripping still is packed with a ceramic intalox saddle- type packing, and the glycol flows downward through the column and enters the reboiler. The wet glycol passing downward through the still is contacted by hot rising glycol and water vapors passing upward through the column. The water vapors released in the reboiler and stripped from the glycol in the strippingstill pass upward through the still column through anatmospheric reflux condenser that provides a partial reflux for the column. The water vapor then leaves the top of the stripping still column and is released to the atmosphere. 9. The glycol flows through the reboiler in essentially a horizontal path from the stripping still column to the opposite end. In the reboiler, the glycol is heated to approximately 350–400 8F to remove enough water vapor to re-concentrate it to 99.5% or higher. In field dehydration units, the reboiler is generally equipped with a direct-fired firebox, using a portion of the natural gas stream for fuel. 10. The re-concentrated glycol leaves the reboiler through an overflow pipe and passes into the shell side of the heat exchanger/surge tank. In the surge tank, the hot re-concentrated glycol is cooled by exchanging heat with the wet glycol stream passing through the coil. The surge tank also acts as a liquid accumulator for feed for the glycol pump. The re-concentrated glycol flows from the surge tank through a strainer and into the glycol pump. From the pump, it passes into the shell side of the glycol cooler mounted on the glycol- gas contactor. It then flows upward through the glycol cooler where it is further cooled and enters the column on the top tray. 10.3.2.3.2 Advantages and Limitations Glycol dehy- drators have several advantages including the following: .Low initial equipment cost .Low pressure drop across absorption towers .Continuous operation .Makeup requirements may be added readily .Recharging of towers presents no problems .Plant may be used satisfactorily in the presence of materials that would cause fouling of some solid adsorbents Glycol dehydrators also present several operating prob- lems including the following: .Suspended matter, such as dirt, scale, and iron oxide, may contaminate glycol solutions.010203040506070 Operating Pressure (psia)Gas Capacity (MMscfd)16 20 24 30 36 42 48 54 60OD, in. 0 200 400 600 800 1,000 1,200 Figure 10.9 Gas capacity of vertical inlet scrubbers based on 0.7-specific gravity at 100 8F (Guo and Ghalambor, 2005).10/128 EQUIPMENT DESIGN AND SELECTION.Overheating of solution may produce both low and high boiling decomposition products. .The resultant sludge may collect on heating surfaces, causing some loss in efficiency, or in severe cases, com- plete flow stoppage. .When both oxygen and hydrogen sulfide are present, corrosion may become a problem because of the forma- tion of acid material in glycol solution. .Liquids (e.g., water, light hydrocarbons, or lubrication oils) in inlet gas may require installation of an efficient separator ahead of the absorber. Highly mineralized water entering the system with inlet gas may, over long periods, crystallize and fill the reboiler with solid salts. .Foaming of solution may occur with a resultant carry over of liquid. The addition of a small quantity of anti- foam compound usually remedies this problem. .Some leakage around the packing glands of pumps may be permitted because excessive tightening of packing may result in the scouring of rods. This leakage is col- lected and periodically returned to the system. .Highly concentrated glycol solutions tend to become viscous at low temperatures and, therefore, are hard to pump. Glycol lines may solidify completely at low tem- peratures when the plant is not operating. In cold wea- ther, continuous circulation of part of the solution through the heater may be advisable. This practice can also prevent freezing in water coolers. .To start a plant, all absorber trays must be filled with glycol before good contact of gas and liquid can be expected. This may also become a problem at low cir- culation rates because weep holes on trays may drain solution as rapidly as it is introduced. .Sudden surges should be avoided in starting and shut- ting down a plant. Otherwise, large carryover losses of solution may occur. 10.3.2.3.3 Sizing Glycol Dehydrator Unit Dehydrators with TEG in trays or packed-column contactors can be sized from standard models by using the following information: .Gas flow rate .Specific gravity of gas .Operating pressure .Maximum working pressure of contact .Gas inlet temperature .Outlet gas water content required One of the following two design criteria can be employed: 1. Glycol/water ratio (GWR): A value of 2–6 gal TEG =lbm H2O removed is adequate for most glycol dehydration requirements. Very often 2.5–4.0 gal TEG =lbmH2Oi s used for field dehydrators. 2. Lean TEG concentration from re-concentrator. Most glycol re-concentrators can output 99.0–99.9% lean TEG. A value of 99.5% lean TEG is used in most designs. Inlet Scrubber . It is essential to have a good inlet scrubber for efficient operation of a glycol dehydrator unit. Two-phase inlet scrubbers are gener ally constructed with 71⁄2-ft shell heights. The required minimum diameter of a vertical inlet scrubber can be determined based on the operating pressure and required gas capacity using Fig. 10.9, which was prepared by Guo and Ghalambor (2005) based on Sivalls’s data (1977). Glycol-Gas Contactor . Glycol contactors are generally con- structed with a standard height of 71⁄2ft. The minimum required diameter of the contactor can be determined based on the gas capacity of the contactor for standard gas of 0.7 specific gravity at standard temperature 100 8F. If the gas is not the standard gas and/or the operating temperature is different from the standard temperature, a correction should be first made using the following relation:qs¼q CtCg, (10:7) where q¼gas capacity of contactor at operating conditions, MMscfd qs¼gas capacity of contactor for standard gas (0.7 specific gravity) at standard temperature (100 8F), MMscfd Ct¼correction factor for operating temperature Cg¼correction factor for gas-specific gravity The temperature and gas-specific gravity correction fac- tors for trayed glycol contactors are given in Tables 10.9 and 10.10, respectively. The temperature and specific grav- ity factors for packed glycol contactors are contained in Tables 10.11 and 10.12, respectively. Once the gas capacity of the contactor for standard gas at standard temperature is calculated, the required minimum diameter of a trayed glycol contactor can be calculated using Fig. 10.10. The required minimum diam- eter of a packed glycol contactor can be determined based on Fig. 10.11.

A more detailed procedure for determination of the required reboiler heat load can be found from Ikoku (1984). The general overall size of the reboiler can be determined as follows: Afb¼Ht 7,000, (10:10) where Afbis the total firebox surface area in squared feet. Glycol Circulating Pump : The glycol circulating pump can be sized using the glycol circulation rate and the maximum operating pressure of the contactor. Commonly used glycol- powered pumps use the rich glycol from the bottom of the contactortopowerthepumpandpumptheleanglycoltothe top of the contactor. The manufacturers of these pumps should be consulted to meet the specific needs of the glycol dehydrator.Glycol Flash Separator : A glycol flash separator is usually installed downstream from the glycol pump to remove any entrained hydrocarbons from the rich glycol. A small 125-psi vertical two-phase separator is usually adequate for this purpose. The separator should be sized based on a liquid retention time in the vessel of at least 5 minutes.

The hydrocarbon gas released from the flash separator can be piped to the reboiler to use as fuel gas and stripping gas. Based on the glycol circulation rate and the operating pressure of the contactor, the amount of gas avail- able from the glycol pump can be determined. Stripping Still : The size of the packed stripping still for the glycol re-concentrator can be determined based on the glycol-to-water circulation rate (gas TEG =lbmH2O) and the glycol circulation rate (gph). The required diameter for the stripping still is normally based on the required diam- eter at the base of the still using the vapor and liquid loading conditions at the base point. The vapor load con- sists of the water vapor and stripping gas flowing up through the still. The liquid load consists of the rich glycol stream and reflux flowing downward through the still column. One tray is normally sufficient for most stripping still requirements for TEG dehydration units. The amount of stripping gas required to re-concentrate the glycol is approximately 2- - -10 ft3per gal of glycol circulated.

Pumps and compressors are used for providing pressures required for the transportation. This chapter presents principles of pumps and compressors and techniques that are used for selecting these equipments. Pipeline design criteria and fluid flow in pipelines are also discussed. Flow assurance issues are addressed. 11.2 Pumps Reciprocating piston pumps (also called ‘‘slush pumps’’ or ‘‘power pumps’’) are widely used for transporting crude oil through pipelines. There are two types of piston strokes: the single-action piston stroke and the double-actionpiston stroke. These are graphically shown in Figs. 11.1 and 11.2. The double-action stroke is used for duplex (two pistons) pumps. The single-action stroke is used for pumps with three or more pistons (e.g., triplex pump). Normally, duplex pumps can handle higher flow rate and triplex pumps can provide higher pressure. 11.2.1 Triplex Pumps The work per stroke for a single piston is expressed as W1¼PpD2 4/C18/C19 L(ft/C0lbs): The work per one rotation of crank is W2¼PpD2 4/C18/C19 L(1) (ft /C0lbs)=rotation, Figure 11.1 Double-action stroke in a duplex pump.

Example Problem 11.1 A pipeline transporting 5,000 bbl/ day of oil requires a pump with a minimum output pressure of 1,000 psi. The available suction pressure is 300 psi. Select a triplex pump for this operation. Solution Assuming a mechanical efficient of 0.85, the horsepower requirement is HP i¼pqo 58,766 em¼(1,000)(5,000) 58,766(0 :85)¼100 hp : According to a product sheet of the Oilwell Plunger Pumps, the Model 336-ST Triplex with forged steel fluid end has a rated brake horsepower of 160 hp at 320 rpm. The maximum working pressure is 3,180 psi with the minimum plunger (piston) size of 13⁄4in. It requires a suction pressure of 275 psi. With 3-in. plungers, the pump displacement is 0.5508 gal/rpm, and it can deliver liquid flow rates in the range of 1,889 bbl/day (55.08 gpm) at 100 rpm to 6,046 bbl/day (176.26 gpm) at 320 rpm, allowing a maximum pressure of 1,420 psi. This pump can be selected for the operation. The required operating rpm is RPM ¼(5,000)(42) (24)(60)(0 :5508)¼265 rpm :11.3 Compressors When natural gas does not have sufficient potential energy to flow, a compressor station is needed. Five types of compressor stations are generally used in the natural gas production industry: .Field gas-gathering stations to gather gas from wells in which pressure is insufficient to produce at a desired rate of flow into a transmission or distribution system. These stations generally handle suction pressures from below atmospheric pressure to 750 psig and volumes from a few thousand to many million cubic feet per day. .Relay or main-line stations to boost pressure in trans- mission lines compress generally large volumes of gas at a pressure range between 200 and 1,300 psig. .Re-pressuring or recycling stations to provide gas pres- sures as high as 6,000 psig for processing or secondary oil recovery projects. .Storage field stations to compress trunk line gas for injection into storage wells at pressures up to 4,000 psig. .Distribution plant stations to pump gas from holder supply to medium- or high-pressure distribution lines at about 20–100 psig, or pump into bottle storage up to 2,500 psig. 11.3.1 Types of Compressors The compressors used in today’s natural gas production industry fall into two distinct types: reciprocating and rotary compressors. Reciprocating compressors are most commonly used in the natural gas industry. They are built for practically all pressures and volumetric capacities. As shown in Fig. 11.3, reciprocating compressors have more moving parts and, therefore, lower mechanical efficiencies than rotary compressors. Each cylinder assembly of a reciprocation compressor consists of a piston, cylinder, cylinder heads, suction and discharge valves, and other parts necessary to convert rotary motion to reciprocation motion. A reciprocating compressor is designed for a cer- tain range of compression ratios through the selection of proper piston displacement and clearance volume within the cylinder. This clearance volume can be either fixed or variable, depending on the extent of the operation range and the percent of load variation desired. A typical recip- rocating compressor can deliver a volumetric gas flow rate up to 30,000 cubic feet per minute (cfm) at a discharge pressure up to 10,000 psig. Figure 11.3 Elements of a typical reciprocating compressor (courtesy of Petroleum Extension Services).11/136 EQUIPMENT DESIGN AND SELECTIONRotary compressors are divided into two classes: the centrifugal compressor and the rotary blower. A centrifu- gal compressor (Fig. 11.4) consists of a housing with flow passages, a rotating shaft on which the impeller is mounted, bearings, and seals to prevent gas from escaping along the shaft. Centrifugal compressors have few moving parts because only the impeller and shaft rotate. Thus, its efficiency is high and lubrication oil consumption and maintenance costs are low. Cooling water is normally unnecessary because of lower compression ratio and lower friction loss. Compression rates of centrifugal com- pressors are lower because of the absence of positive dis- placement. Centrifugal compressors compress gas using centrifugal force. In this type of compressor, work is done on the gas by an impeller. Gas is then discharged at a high velocity into a diffuser where the velocity is reduced and its kinetic energy is converted to static pressure. Unlike reciprocating compressors, all this is done without confinement and physical squeezing. Centrifugal compres- sors with relatively unrestricted passages and continuous flow are inherently high-capacity, low-pressure ratio ma- chines that adapt easily to series arrangements within a station. In this way, each compressor is required to develop only part of the station compression ratio. Typically, the volume is more than 100,000 cfm and discharge pressure is up to 100 psig. A rotary blower is built of a casing in which one or more impellers rotate in opposite directions. Rotary blowers are primarily used in distribution systems where the pressure differential between suction and discharge is less than 15 psi. They are also used for refrigeration and closed regeneration of adsorption plants. The rotary blower has several advantages: large quantities of low-pressure gas can be handled at comparatively low horsepower, it has small initial cost and low maintenance cost, it is simple to install and easy to operate and attend, it requires minimumfloor space for the quantity of gas removed, and it has almost pulsation-less flow. As its disadvantages, it cannot withstand high pressures, it has noisy operation because of gear noise and clattering impellers, it improperly seals the clearance between the impellers and the casing, and it overheats if operated above safe pressures. Typically, rotary blowers deliver a volumetric gas flow rate of up to 17,000 cfm and have a maximum intake pressure of 10 psig and a differential pressure of 10 psi. When selecting a compressor, the pressure–volume characteristics and the type of driver must be considered. Small rotary compressors (vane or impeller type) are gen- erally driven by electric motors. Large-volume positive compressors operate at lower speeds and are usually driven by steam or gas engines. They may be driven through reduction gearing by steam turbines or an electric motor. Reciprocation compressors driven by steam tur- bines or electric motors are most widely used in the natural gas industry as the conventional high-speed compression machine. Selection of compressors requires considerations of volumetric gas deliverability, pressure, compression ratio, and horsepower. The following are important characteristics of the two types of compressors: .Reciprocating piston compressors can adjust pressure output to backpressure. .Reciprocating compressors can vary their volumetric flow-rate output (within certain limits). .Reciprocating compressors have a volumetric efficiency, which is related to the relative clearance volume of the compressor design. .Rotary compressors have a fixed pressure ratio, so they have a constant pressure output. .Rotary compressors can vary their volumetric flow-rate output (within certain limits).

Most field applica- tions require multistage compressors (two, three, and some- times four stages) to reduce compression ratio in each stage. Figure 11.6 shows a two-stage compression unit. Using com- pressorstageswith perfect intercooling between stages gives a theoretical minimum power for gas compression. To obtain this minimum power, the compression ratio in each stage must be the same and the cooling between each stage must bring the gas entering each stage to the same temperature. 1 14 7 Knockout drums (to remove condensed liquids) Compressors (first and second stages) Interstage cooler/intercooler (air −type) Aftercooler (air −type)5 32 623 4 56 7 Figure 11.6 Flow diagram of a two-stage compression unit.TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS 11/139The compression ratio in each stage should be less than six to increase compression efficiency. The equation to calculate stage-compression ratio is rs¼Pdis Pin/C18/C191=ns , (11 :56) where Pdis,Pin, and nsare final discharge pressure, inlet pressure, and number of stages, respectively. For a two-stage compression, the compression ratio for each stage should be rs¼ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ Pdis Pinr : (11:57) Using Eq.

We take the derivative of Eq. (11.59) with respect to Pdis1and set this equal to zero and solve for Pdis1. This gives Pdis1¼ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ Pin1Pdis2p , which proves Eq. (11.57). For the two-stage compressor, Eq. (11.59) can be rewritten as Ptotal¼2k k/C01wtRT1Pdis2 Pin1/C18/C19 k/C01 2k /C01\"# : (11:60) The ideal intercooling does not extend to the gas exiting the compressor. Gas exiting the compressor is governed by Eq. (11.41). Usually there is an adjustable after-cooler on a compressor that allows the operators to control the temperature of the exiting flow of gas. For greater number of stages, Eq. (11.60) can be written in field units as HP t¼nsp1q1 229:2k (k/C01)p2 p1/C18/C19 k/C01 nsk /C01\"# (11:61) or HP t¼181:79nspbT1QMM Tbk (k/C01)p2 p1/C18/C19 k/C01 nsk /C01\"# :(11:62) In the above, p1(psia) is the intake pressure of the gas and p2(psia) is the outlet pressure of the compressor after the final stage, q1is the actual cfm of gas into the compressor, HP tis the theoretical horsepower needed to compress the gas. This HP tvalue has to be matched with a prime mover motor. The proceeding equations have been coded in the spreadsheet ReciprocatingCompressorPower.xls for quick calculations. Reciprocating compressors have a clearance at the end of the piston. This clearance produces a volumetric effi- ciency ev. The relation is given byev¼0:96 1 /C0«r1 ks/C01hino , (11 :63) where «is the clearance ratio defined as the clearance volume at the end of the piston stroke divided by the entire volume of the chamber (volume contacted by the gas in the cylinder). In addition, there is a mechanical efficiency emof the compressor and its prime mover. This results in two separate expressions for calculating the required HP t for reciprocating compressors and rotary compressors. The required minimum input prime mover motor to practically operate the compressor (either reciprocating or rotary) is HP in¼HP t evem, (11 :64) where ev/C250:80/C00:99 and em/C250:80 to 0 :95 for recipro- cating compressors, and ev¼1:0 and em/C250:70 to 0 :75 for rotary compressors. Equation (11.64) stands for the input power required by the compressor, which is the minimum power to be provided by the prime mover. The prime movers usually have fixed power HP punder normal operating conditions. The usable prime mover power ratio is PR¼HP in HP p: (11:65) If the prime mover is not fully loaded by the compressor, its rotary speed increases and fue l consumption thus increases. Figure 11.7 shows fuel consump tion curves for prime movers using gasoline, propane/butane, and diesel as fuel. Figure 11.8 presents fuel consumption curve for prime movers using nat- ural gas as fuel. It is also important to know that the prime mover power drops with surface location elevation (Fig. 11.9).

Pipelines have demonstrated an ability to adapt to a wide variety of environments including remote areas and hostile environments. With very minor exceptions, largely due to local peculiarities, most refineries are served by one or more pipelines, because of their superior flexibility to the alternatives. Pipelines can bedivided into different categories, including the following: .Flowlines transporting oil and/or gas from satellite wells to manifolds .Flowlines transporting oil and/or gas from manifolds to production facility .Infield flowlines transporting oil and/or gas from between production facilities .Export pipelines transporting oil and/or gas from production facilities to refineries/users The pipelines are sized to handle the expected pressure and fluid flow on the basis of flow assurance analysis. This section covers the following topics: 1. Flow in oil and gas pipelines 2. Design of pipelines 3. Operation of pipelines. 11.4.1 Flow in Pipelines Designing a long-distance pipeline for transportation of crude oil and natural gas requires knowledge of flow formulas for calculating capacity and pressure require- ments. Based on the first law of thermal dynamics, the total pressure gradient is made up of three distinct components: dP dL¼g gcrsinuþfMru2 2gcDþrudu gcdL, (11 :78) where g gcrsinu¼pressure gradient due to elevation or potential energy change fMru2 2gcD¼pressure gradient due to frictional lossesTRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS 11/143rudu gcdL¼pressure gradient due to acceleration or kinetic energy change P¼pressure, lbf =ft2 L¼pipe length, ft g¼gravitational acceleration, ft =sec2 gc¼32:17, ft-lbm =lbf-sec2 r¼density lbm =ft3 u¼dip angle from horizontal direction, degrees fM¼Darcy–Wiesbach (Moody) friction factor u¼flow velocity, ft/sec D¼pipe inner diameter, ft The elevation component is pipe-angle dependent. It is zero for horizontal flow. The friction loss component applies to any type of flow at any pipe angle and causes a pressure drop in the direction of flow. The acceleration component causes a pressure drop in the direction of velocity increase in any flow condition in which velocity changes occurs. It is zero for constant-area, incompressible flow. This term is normally negligible for both oil and gas pipelines. The friction factor fMin Eq. (11.78) can be determined based on flow regimes, that is, laminar flow or turbulent flow. Reynolds number ( NRe) is used as a parameter to distinguish between laminar and turbulent fluid flow. Reynolds number is defined as the ratio of fluid momen- tum force to viscous shear force. The Reynolds number can be expressed as a dimensionless group defined as NRe¼Dur m, (11:79) where D¼pipe ID, ft u¼fluid velocity, f/sec r¼fluid density, lb m=ft3 m¼fluid viscosity, lb m=ft-sec. The change from laminar to turbulent flow is usually assumed to occur at a Reynolds number of 2,100 for flowin a circular pipe. If U.S. field units of ft for diameter, ft/ sec for velocity, lb m=ft3for density and centipoises for viscosity are used, the Reynolds number equation becomes NRe¼1,488Dur m: (11:80) For a gas with specific gravity ggand viscosity mg (cp) flowing in a pipe with an inner diameter D(in.) at flow rate q(Mcfd) measured at base conditions of Tb (8R) and pb(psia), the Reynolds number can be expressed as NRe¼711pbqgg TbDmg: (11:81) The Reynolds number usually takes values greater than 10,000 in gas pipelines. As Tbis 520 8R and pbvaries only from 14.4 to 15.025 psia in the United States, the value of 711pb/Tb varies between 19.69 and 20.54. For all practical purposes, the Reynolds number for natural gas flow prob- lems may be expressed as NRe¼20qgg mgd, (11 :82) where q¼gas flow rate at 60 8F and 14.73 psia, Mcfd gg¼gas-specific gravity (air ¼1) mg¼gas viscosity at in-situ temperature and pressure, cp d¼pipe diameter, in. The coefficient 20 becomes 0.48 if qis in scfh. Figure 11.10 is a friction factor chart covering the full range of flow conditions. It is a log-log graph of (log fM) versus (log NRe). Because of the complex nature of the curves, the equation for the friction factor in terms of the Reynolds number and relative roughness varies in different regions. In the laminar flow region, the friction factor can be determined analytically. The Hagen–Poiseuille equation for laminar flow is 00.010.020.030.040.050.060.070.080.090.1 1.E+02 1.E+03 1.E+04 1.E+05 1.E+06 1.E+07 1.E+08 Reynolds NumberFriction Factor0 0.000001 0.000005 0.00001 0.00005 0.0001 0.0002 0.0004 0.0006 0.001 0.002 0.004 0.006 0.01 0.015 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05Laminar FlowRelative roughness Turbulent Flow Figure 11.10 Darcy–Wiesbach friction factor chart (Moody, 1944).11/144 EQUIPMENT DESIGN AND SELECTIONdp dL/C18/C19 f¼32mu gcD2: (11:83) Equating the frictional pressure gradients given by Eqs. (11.78) and (11.83) gives fMru2 2gcD¼32mu gcD2, (11 :84) which yields fM¼64m dur¼64 NRe: (11:85) In the turbulent flow region, a number of empirical cor- relations for friction factors are available. Only the most accurate ones are presented in this section. For smooth wall pipes in the turbulent flow region, Drew et al. (1930) presented the most commonly used correlation: fM¼0:0056þ0:5 N0:32 Re, (11 :86) which is valid over a wide range of Reynolds numbers, 3/C2103<NRe<3/C2106. For rough wall pipes in the turbulent flow region, the effect of wall roughness on friction factor depends on the relative roughness and Reynolds number. The Nikur- adse (1933) friction factor correlation is still the best one available for fully developed turbulent flow in rough pipes: 1ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ fMp ¼1:74/C02 log (2 eD) (11 :87) This equation is valid for large values of the Reynolds number where the effect of relative roughness is dominant. The correlation that is used as the basis for modern friction factor charts was proposed by Colebrook (1938): 1ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ fMp ¼1:74/C02 log 2 eDþ18:7 NReﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ fMp ! , (11 :88) which is applicable to smooth pipes and to flow in transition and fully rough zones of turbulent flow. It degenerates to the Nikuradse correlation at large values of the Reynolds number. Equation (11.88) is not explicit infM. However, values of fMcan be obtained by a numer- ical procedure such as Newton–Raphson iteration. An explicit correlation for friction factor was presented by Jain (1976): 1ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ fMp ¼1:14/C02 log eDþ21:25 N0:9 Re/C18/C19 : (11:89) This correlation is comparable to the Colebrook correlation. For relative roughness between 10/C06and 10/C02and the Reynolds number between 5 /C2103and 108, the errors were reported to be within +1% when compared with the Cole- brookcorrelation.Therefore,Eq.(11.89)isrecommendedfor all calculations requiring friction factor determination of turbulent flow. The wall roughness is a function of pipe material, method of manufacturing, and the environment to which it has been exposed. From a microscopic sense, wall roughness is not uniform, and thus, the distance from the peaks to valleys on the wall surface will vary greatly. The absolute roughness, «, of a pipe wall is defined as the mean protruding height of relatively uniformly distributed and sized, tightly packed sand grains that would give the same pressure gradient behavior as the actual pipe wall. Analysis has suggested that the effect of roughness is not due to its absolute dimensions, but to its dimensionsrelative to the inside diameter of the pipe. Relative rough- ness, eD, is defined as the ratio of the absolute roughness to the pipe internal diameter: eD¼« D, (11:90) where «andDhave the same unit. The absolute roughness is not a directly measurable property for a pipe, which makes the selection of value of pipe wall roughness difficult. The way to evaluate the absolute roughness is to compare the pressure gradients obtained from the pipe of interest with a pipe that is sand- roughened. If measured pressure gradients are available, the friction factor and Reynolds number can be calculated and an effective eDobtained from the Moody diagram. This value of eDshould then be used for future predictions until updated. If no information is available on roughness, a value of «¼0:0006 in. is recommended for tubing and line pipes. 11.4.1.1 Oil Flow This section addresses flow of crude oil in pipelines. Flow of multiphase fluids is discussed in other literatures such as that of Guo et al. (2005). Crude oil can be treated as an incompressible fluid. The relation between flow velocity and driving pressure differ- ential for a given pipeline geometry and fluid properties is readily obtained by integration of Eq. (11.78) when the kinetic energy term is neglected: P1/C0P2¼g gcrsinuþfMru2 2gcD/C18/C19 L, (11 :91) which can be written in flow rate as P1/C0P2¼g gcrsinuþfMrq2 2gcDA2/C18/C19 L, (11 :92) where q¼liquid flow rate, ft3=sec A¼inner cross-sectional area, ft2 When changed to U.S. field units, Eq.

The mechanical energy equation, Eq. (11.78), becomes dp dL¼fMru2 2gcD¼p(MW )a zRTfu2 2gcD, (11 :94) which serves as a base for development of many pipeline equations. The difference in these equations originated from the methods used in handling the z-factor and fric- tion factor. Integrating Eq.

If Lis in miles andqis in scfd, C¼77:54. The use of Eq. (11.97) involves an iterative procedure. The gas deviation factor depends on pressure and the friction factor depends on flow rate. This problem prompted several investigators to develop pipeline flowequations that are noniterative or explicit. This has in- volved substitutions for the friction factor fM. The specific substitution used may be diameter-dependent only (Weymouth equation) or Reynolds number–dependent only (Panhandle equations). 11.4.1.2.1 Weymouth Equation for Horizontal Flow Equation (11.97) takes the following form when the unit of scfh for gas flow rate is used: qh¼3:23Tb pbﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 1 fMs ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ (p2 1/C0p2 2)d5 gg/C22T T/C22z zLs , (11 :98) whereﬃﬃﬃﬃ 1 fMq is called the ‘‘transmission factor.’’ The friction factor may be a function of flow rate and pipe roughness. If flow conditions are in the fully turbulent region, Eq. (11.89) degenerates to fM¼1 [1:14/C02 log ( eD)]2, (11 :99) where fMdepends only on the relative roughness, eD. When flow conditions are not completely turbulent, fM depends on the Reynolds number also. Therefore, use of Eq. (11.98) requires a trial-and-error procedure to calculate qh. To eliminate the trial-and-error procedure, Weymouth proposed that fvary as a function of diameter as follows: fM¼0:032 d1=3(11:100) With this simplification, Eq. (11.98) reduces to qh¼18:062Tb pbﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ (p2 1/C0p2 2)D16=3 gg/C22T T/C22z zLs , (11 :101) which is the form of the Weymouth equation commonly used in the natural gas industry. The use of the Weymouth equation for an existing transmission line or for the design of a new transmission line involves a few assumptions including no mechanical work, steady flow, isothermal flow, constant compressibil- ity factor, horizontal flow, and no kinetic energy change. These assumptions can affect accuracy of calculation results. In the study of an existing pipeline, the pressure-mea- suring stations should be placed so that no mechanical energy is added to the system between stations. No me- chanical work is done on the fluid between the points at which the pressures are measured. Thus, the condition of no mechanical work can be fulfilled. Steady flow in pipeline operation seldom, if ever, exists in actual practice because pulsations, liquid in the pipeline, and variations in input or output gas volumes cause devi- ations from steady-state conditions. Deviations from steady-state flow are the major cause of difficulties experi- enced in pipeline flow studies. The heat of compression is usually dissipated into the ground along a pipeline within a few miles downstream from the compressor station. Otherwise, the temperature of the gas is very near that of the containing pipe, and because pipelines usually are buried, the temperature of the flowing gas is not influenced appreciably by rapid changes in atmospheric temperature. Therefore, the gas flow can be considered isothermal at an average effective temperature without causing significant error in long- pipeline calculations. The compressibility of the fluid can be considered con- stant and an average effective gas deviation factor may be used. When the two pressures p1andp2lie in a region where zis essentially linear with pressure, it is accurate enough to evaluate z¯at the average pressure /C22p p¼(p1þp2)=2. One can also use the arithmetic average11/146 EQUIPMENT DESIGN AND SELECTIONof the z’s with /C22z z¼(z1þz2)=2, where z1and z2are obtained at p1andp2, respectively. On the other hand, should p1andp2lie in the range where zis not linear with pressure (double-hatched lines), the proper average would result from determining the area under the z-curve and dividing it by the difference in pressure: /C22z z¼Ðp2 p1zdp (p1/C0p2), (11 :102) where the numerator can be evaluated numerically. Also, z¯ can be evaluated at an average pressure given by /C22p p¼2 3p3 1/C0p3 2 p2 1/C0p2 2/C18/C19 : (11:103) Regarding the assumption of horizontal pipeline, in actual practice, transmission lines seldom, if ever, are horizontal, so that factors are needed in Eq. (11.101) to compensate for changes in elevation. With the trend to higher operat- ing pressures in transmission lines, the need for these factors is greater than is generally realized. This issue of correction for change in elevation is addressed in the next section. If the pipeline is long enough, the changes in the kinetic- energy term can be neglected. The assumption is justified for work with commercial transmission lines.

In actual pipelines, water, condensates, sometimes crude oil accumulates in low spots in the line. There are often scales and even ‘‘junk’’ left in the line. The net result is that the flow rates calculated for the 100% efficient cases are often modified by multiplying them by an efficiency factor E. The efficiency factor expresses the actual flow capacity as a fraction of the theoretical flow rate. An efficiency factor ranging from 0.85 to 0.95 would represent a ‘‘clean’’ line. Table 11.1 presents typical values of efficiency factors. 11.4.2 Design of Pipelines Pipeline design includes determination of material, diam- eter, wall thickness, insulation, and corrosion protection measure. For offshore pipelines, it also includes weight coating and trenching for stability control. Bai (2001) provides a detailed description on the analysis–analysis- based approach to designing offshore pipelines. Guo et al. (2005) presents a simplified approach to the pipeline design. The diameter of pipeline should be determined based on flow capacity calculations presented in the previous sec- tion. This section focuses on the calculations to design wall thickness and insulation. 11.4.2.1 Wall Thickness Design Wall thickness design for steel pipelines is governed by U.S. Code ASME/ANSI B32.8. Other codes such as Z187 (Canada), DnV (Norway), and IP6 (UK) have es- sentially the same requirements but should be checked by the readers. Except for large-diameter pipes ( >30 in.), material grade is usually taken as X-60 or X-65 (414 or 448 MPa) for high-pressure pipelines or on deepwater. Higher grades can be selected in special cases. Lower grades such as X-42, X-52, or X-56 can be selected in shallow water or for low- pressure, large-diameter pipelines to reduce material cost or in cases in which high ductility is required for improved impact resistance. Pipe types include .Seamless .Submerged arc welded (SAW or DSAW)Table 11.1 Typical Values of Pipeline Efficiency Factors Type of lineLiquid content (gal/MMcf) Efficiency E Dry-gas field 0.1 0.92 Casing-head gas 7.2 0.77 Gas and condensate 800 0.611/148 EQUIPMENT DESIGN AND SELECTION.Electric resistance welded (ERW) .Spiral weld. Except in specific cases, only seamless or SAW pipes are to be used, with seamless being the preference for diameters of 12 in. or less. If ERW pipe is used, special inspection provisions such as full-body ultrasonic testing are re- quired. Spiral weld pipe is very unusual for oil/gas pipe- lines and should be used only for low-pressure water or outfall lines. 11.4.2.1.1 Design Procedure Determination of pipeline wall thickness is based on the design internal pressure or the external hydrostatic pressure. Maximum longitudinal stresses and combined stresses are sometimes limited by applicable codes and must be checked for installation and operation. However, these criteria are not normally used for wall thickness determination. Increasing wall thickness can sometimes ensure hydrodynamic stability in lieu of other stabilization methods (such as weight coating). This is not normally economical, except in deepwater where the presence of concrete may interfere with the preferred installation method. We recommend the following procedure for designing pipeline wall thickness: Step 1: Calculate the minimum wall thickness required for the design internal pressure. Step 2: Calculate the minimum wall thickness required to withstand external pressure. Step 3: Add wall thickness allowance for corrosion if ap- plicable to the maximum of the above. Step 4: Select next highest nominal wall thickness. Step 5: Check selected wall thickness for hydrotest condi- tion.Step 6: Check for handling practice, that is, pipeline han- dling is difficult for D/t larger than 50; welding of wall thickness less than 0.3 in (7.6 mm) requires special provisions. Note that in certain cases, it may be desirable to order a nonstandard wall. This can be done for large orders. Pipelines are sized on the basis of the maximum expected stresses in the pipeline under operating condi- tions. The stress calculation methods are different for thin-wall and thick-wall pipes. A thin-wall pipe is defined as a pipe with D/tgreater than or equal to 20. Figure 11.11 shows stresses in a thin-wall pipe. A pipe with D/tless than 20 is considered a thick-wall pipe. Figure 11.12 illustrates stresses in a thick-wall pipe. 11.4.2.1.2 Design for Internal Pressure Three pipe- line codes typically used for design are ASME B31.4 (ASME, 1989), ASME B31.8 (ASME, 1990), and DnV 1981 (DnV, 1981). ASME B31.4 is for all oil lines in North America. ASME B31.8 is for all gas lines and two- phase flow pipelines in North America. DnV 1981 is for oil, gas, and two-phase flow pipelines in North Sea. All these codes can be used in other areas when no other code is available. The nominal pipeline wall thickness ( tNOM) can be calculated as follows: tNOM¼PdD 2EwhsyFtþta, (11 :116) where Pdis the design internal pressure defined as the difference between the internal pressure ( Pi) and external pressure ( Pe),Dis nominal outside diameter, tais thick- ness allowance for corrosion, and syis the specified t t r PDsL 4t= rdf dφt sh=DP = ppr 2sL 2tPDsh ffP = ppr2 df Figure 11.11 Stresses generated by internal pressure p in a thin-wall pipe, D/t >20.TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS 11/149minimum yield strength. Equation (11.116) is valid for any consistent units. Most codes allow credit for external pressure. This credit should be used whenever possible, although care should be exercised for oil export lines to account for head of fluid and for lines that traverse from deep to shallow water. ASME B31.4 and DnV 1981 define Pias the maximum allowable operating pressure (MAOP) under normal condi- tions, indicating that surge pressures up to 110% MAOP is acceptable. In some cases, Piis defined as wellhead shut-in pressure (WSIP) for flowlines or specified by the operators. In Eq. (11.116), the weld efficiency factor ( Ew) is 1.0 for seamless, ERW, and DSAW pipes. The temperature de- rating factor ( Ft) is equal to 1.0 for temperatures under 2508F. The usage factor ( h) is defined in Tables 11.2 and 11.3 for oil and gas lines, respectively. The underthickness due to manufacturing tolerance is taken into account in the design factor. There is no need to add any allowance for fabrication to the wall thickness calculated with Eq. (11.116). 11.4.2.1.3 Design for External Pressure Different practices can be found in the industry using differentexternal pressure criteria. As a rule of thumb, or unless qualified thereafter, it is recommended to use propagation criterion for pipeline diameters under 16-in. and collapse criterion for pipeline diameters more than or equal to 16-in. Propagation Criterion: The propagation criterion is more conservative and should be used where optimization of the wall thickness is not required or for pipeline installation methods not compatible with the use of buckle arrestors such as reel and tow methods. It is generally economical to design for propagation pressure for diameters less than 16-in. For greater diameters, the wall thickness penalty is too high. When a pipeline is designed based on the collapse criterion, buckle arrestors are recommended. The external pressure criterion should be based on nominal wall thick- ness, as the safety factors included below account for wall variations. Although a large number of empirical relationships have been published, the recommended formula is the latest given by AGA.PRC (AGA, 1990): PP¼33SytNOM D/C16/C17 2:46 , (11 :117) m1 n1 2m rndrdr drdsr+ shsh2 sr df b a srb = −Psra = −POPm1 mn1 nPOsr Figure 11.12 Stresses generated by internal pressure p in a thick-wall pipe, D/t <20.Table 11.2 Design and Hydrostatic Pressure Definitions and Usage Factors for Oil Lines Parameter ASME B31.4, 1989 Edition Dnv (Veritas, 1981) Design internal pressure Pa d Pi/C0Pe[401:2:2] Pi/C0Pe[4.2.2.2] Usage factor h 0.72 [402.3.1(a)] 0.72 [4.2.2.1] Hydrotest pressure Ph 1:25Pb i[437.4.1(a)] 1 :25Pd[8.8.4.3] aCredit can be taken for external pressure for gathering lines or flowlines when the MAOP ( Pi) is applied at the wellhead or at the seabed.

The nominal wall thickness should be determined such that Pp>1:3Pe. The safety factor of 1.3 is recommended to account for uncer- tainty in the envelope of data points used to derive Eq. (11.117). It can be rewritten as tNOM$D1:3PP 33Sy/C18/C19 1 2:46 : (11:118) For the reel barge method, the preferred pipeline grade is below X-60. However, X-65 steel can be used if the ductility is kept high by selecting the proper steel chemistry and micro- alloying. For deepwater pipelines, D/tratios of less than 30 are recommended. It has been noted that bending loads have no demonstrated influence on the propagation pressure. Collapse Criterion: The mode of collapse is a function of D/tratio, pipeline imperfections, and load conditions. The theoretical background is not given in this book. An em- pirical general formulation that applies to all situations is provided. It corresponds to the transition mode of collapse under external pressure ( Pe), axial tension ( Ta), and bend- ing strain ( sb), as detailed elsewhere (Murphey and Langner, 1985; AGA, 1990). The nominal wall thickness should be determined such that 1:3PP PCþ«b «B#gp, (11 :119) where 1.3 is the recommended safety factor on collapse, «Bis the bending strain of buckling failure due to pure bending, and gis an imperfection parameter defined below.

An upper conservative limit is necessary and must often be estimated. Under high bending loads, care should be taken in esti- mating «busing an appropriate moment-curvature relationship. A Ramberg Osgood relationship can be used as K/C3¼M/C3þAM/C3B, (11 :130) where K/C3¼K=KyandM/C3¼M=Mywith Ky¼2Sy=EDis the yield curvature and My¼2ISy=Dis the yield moment. The coefficients AandBare calculated from the two data points on stress–strain curve generated during a tensile test. 11.4.2.1.4 Corrosion Allowance To account for corrosion when water is present in a fluid along with contaminants such as oxygen, hydrogen sulfide (H 2S), and carbon dioxide (CO 2), extra wall thickness is added. A review of standards, rules, and codes of practices (Hill and Warwick, 1986) shows that wall allowance is only one of several methods available to prevent corrosion, and it is often the least recommended. For H 2S and CO 2contaminants, corrosion is often localized (pitting) and the rate of corrosion allowance ineffective. Corrosion allowance is made to account for damage during fabrication, transportation, and storage. A value of1⁄16in. may be appropriate. A thorough assessment of the internal corrosion mechanism and rate is necessary before any corrosion allowance is taken. 11.4.2.1.5 Check for Hydrotest Condition The min- imum hydrotest pressure for oil and gas lines is given in Tables 11.2 and 11.3, respectively, and is equal to 1.25 times the design pressure for pipelines. Codes do not require that the pipeline be designed for hydrotest conditions but sometimes give a tensile hoop stress limit 90% SMYS, which is always satisfied if credit has not been taken for external pressure. For cases where the wall thickness is based on Pd¼Pi/C0Pe, codes recommend not to overstrain the pipe. Some of the codes are ASME B31.4 (Clause 437.4.1), ASME B31.8 (no limit on hoop stress during hydrotest), and DnV (Clause 8.8.4.3).Table 11.3 Design and Hydrostatic Pressure Definitions and Usage Factors for Gas Lines ParameterASME B31.8, 1989 Edition, 1990 Addendum DnV (Veritas, 1981) Pa d Pi/C0Pe[A842.221] Pi/C0Pe[4.2.2.2] Usage factor h 0.72 [A842.221] 0.72 [4.2.2.1] Hydrotest pressure Ph 1:25Pb i[A847.2] 1 :25Pd[8.8.4.3] aCredit can be taken for external pressure for gathering lines or flowlines when the MAOP ( Pi) is applied at wellhead or at the seabed.

For offshore pipelines connected to riser sections requiring Ph¼1:4Pi, it is recommended to consider testing the riser separately (for prefabricated sections) or to determine the hydrotest pressure based on the actual internal pressure experienced by the pipeline section. It is important to note that most pressure testing of subsea pipelines is done with water, but on occasion, nitrogen or air has been used. For low D/t ratios ( <20), the actual hoop stress in a pipeline tested from the surface is overestimated when using the thin wall equations provided in this chapter. Credit for this effect is allowed by DnV Clause 4.2.2.2 but is not normally taken into account.

The need to keep the product fluids in the pipeline at a temperature higher than the ambient temperature could exist, for reasons including the following: .Preventing formation of gas hydrates .Preventing formation of wax or asphaltenes .Enhancing product flow properties .Increasing cool-down time after shutting down In liquefied gas pipelines, such as liquefied natural gas, insulation is required to maintain the cold temperature of the gas to keep it in a liquid state. Designing pipeline insulation requires thorough knowl- edge of insulation materials and heat transfer mechanisms across the insulation. Accurate predictions of heat loss andtemperature profile in oil- and gas-production pipelines are essential to designing and evaluating pipeline oper- ations. 11.4.2.2.1 Insulation Materials Polypropylene, poly- ethylene, and polyurethane are three base materials widely used in the petroleum indu stry for pipeline insulation. Their thermal conductivities are given in Table 11.4 (Carter et al., 2002). Depending on applic ations, these base materials are used in different forms, re sulting in different overall conductivities. A three-layer polypropylene applied to pipe surface has a conduct ivity of 0.225 W/M- 8C (0.13 btu/hr-ft- 8F), while a four-layer polypropylene has a conductivity of 0.173 W/M- 8C (0.10 btu/hr-ft- 8F). Solid polypropylene has higher conductivity than polypropylene foam. Polymer syntactic polyurethane has a conductivity of 0.121 W/M- 8C (0.07 btu/hr-ft- 8F), while glass syntactic polyurethane has a conductivity of 0.156 W/M- 8C (0.09 btu/hr-ft- 8F). These materials have lower conductivities in dry conditions such as that in pipe-in-pipe (PIP) applications. Because of their low thermal conductivities, more and more polyurethane foams are used in deepwater pipeline applications. Physical properties of polyurethane foams include density, compressive strength, thermal conductiv- ity, closed-cell content, leachable halides, flammability, tensile strength, tensile modulus, and water absorption. Typical values of these properties are available elsewhere (Guo et al., 2005). In steady-state flow conditions in an insulated pipeline segment, the heat flow through the pipe wall is given by Qr¼UA rDT, (11 :131) where Qris heat-transfer rate; Uis overall heat-transfer coefficient (OHTC) at the reference radius; Aris area of the pipeline at the reference radius; DTis the difference in temperature between the pipeline product and the ambient temperature outside. The OHTC, U, for a system is the sum of the thermal resistances and is given by (Holman, 1981): U¼1 Ar1 AihiþPn m¼1ln (rmþ1=rm) 2pLkmþ1 Aoho/C20/C21 , (11 :132) Table 11.4 Thermal Conductivities of Materials Used in Pipeline Insulation Thermal conductivity Material name W/M- 8C Btu/hr-ft- 8F Polyethylene 0.35 0.20 Polypropylene 0.22 0.13 Polyurethane 0.12 0.07 Table 11.5 Typical Performance of Insulated Pipelines U-Value Water depth (M) Insulation type (Btu=hr/C0ft2/C0/C14F) W=M2/C0K Field proven Potential Solid polypropylene 0.50 2.84 1,600 4,000 Polypropylene foam 0.28 1.59 700 2,000 Syntactic polyurethane 0.32 1.81 1,200 3,300 Syntactic polyurethane foam 0.30 1.70 2,000 3,300 Pipe-in-pipe syntactic polyurethane foam 0.17 0.96 3,100 4,000 Composite 0.12 0.68 1,000 3,000 Pipe-in-pipe high efficiency 0.05 0.28 1,700 3,000 Glass syntactic polyurethane 0.03 0.17 2,300 3,00011/152 EQUIPMENT DESIGN AND SELECTIONwhere hiis film coefficient of pipeline inner surface; hois film coefficient of pipeline outer surface; Aiis area of pipe- line inner surface; Aois area of pipeline outer surface; rmis radius of layer m;a n d kmis thermal conductivity of layer m. Similar equations exist for transient-heat flow, giving an instantaneous rate for heat flow. Typically required insulation performance, in terms of OHTC ( Uvalue) of steel pipelines in water, is summarized in Table 11.5. Pipeline insulation comes in two main types: dry insula- tion and wet insulation. The dry insulations require an outer barrier to prevent water ingress (PIP). The most common types of this include the following: .Closed-cell polyurethane foam .Open-cell polyurethane foam .Poly-isocyanurate foam .Extruded polystyrene .Fiber glass .Mineral wool .Vacuum-insulation panels Under certain conditions, PIP systems may be considered over conventional single-pipe systems. PIP insulation may be required to produce fluids from high-pressure/high- temperature ( >150 8C) reservoirs in deepwater (Carmi- chael et al., 1999). The annulus between pipes can be filled with different types of insulation materials such as foam, granular particles, gel, and inert gas or vacuum. A pipeline-bundled system—a special configuration of PIP insulation—can be used to group individual flowlines together to form a bundle (McKelvie, 2000); heat-up lines can be included in the bundle, if necessary. The complete bundle may be transported to site and installed with a considerable cost savings relative to other methods. The extra steel required for the carrier pipe and spacers can sometimes be justified (Bai, 2001). Wet-pipeline insulations are those materials that do not need an exterior steel barrier to prevent water ingress, or the water ingress is negligible and d oes not degrade the insulation properties. The most common types of this are as follows: .Polyurethane .Polypropylene .Syntactic polyurethane .Syntactic polypropylene .Multilayered The main materials that have been used for deepwater insu- lations have been polyurethane and polypropylene based. Syntactic versions use plastic or glass matrix to improve insulation with greater depth capabilities. Insulation coat- ings with combinations of the two materials have also been used. Guo et al. (2005) gives the properties of these wet insulations. Because the insulation is buoyant, this effect must be compensated by the steel pipe weight to obtain lateral stability of the deepwater pipeline on the seabed. 11.4.2.2.2 Heat Transfer Models Heat transfer across the insulation of pipelines presents a unique problem affecting flow efficiency. Although sophisticated computer packages are available for predicting fluid temperatures, their accuracies suffer from numerical treatments because long pipe segments have to be used to save computing time. This is especially true for transient fluid-flow analyses in which a very large number of numerical iterations are performed. Ramey (1962) was among the first investigators who stud- ied radial-heat transfer across a well casing with no insula- tion. He derived a mathematical heat-transfer model for an outer medium that is infinitely large. Miller (1980) analyzed heat transfer around a geothermal wellbore without ins- ulation. Winterfeld (1989) and Almehaideb et al. (1989)considered temperature effect on pressure-transient analyses in well testing. Stone et al. (1989) developed a numerical simulator to couple fluid flow and heat flow in a wellbore and reservoir. More advanced studies on the wellbore heat- transfer problem were conducted by Hasan and Kabir (1994, 2002), Hasan et al. (1997, 1998), and Kabir et al. (1996). Although multilayers of materials have been considered in these studies, the external temperature gradient in the longi- tudinal direction has not been systematically taken into ac- count. Traditionally, if the outer temperature changes with length, the pipe must be divided into segments, with assumed constant outer temperature in each segment, and numerical algorithms are required for heat-transfer computation. The accuracy of the computation depends on the number of segments used. Fine segments can be employed to ensure accuracy with computing time sacrificed. Guo et al. (2006) presented three analytical heat-transfer solutions. They are the transient-flow solution for startup mode, steady-flow solution for normal operation mode, and transient-flow solution for flow rate change mode (shutting down is a special mode in which the flow rate changes to zero). Temperature and Heat Transfer for Steady Fluid Flow . The internal temperature profile under steady fluid-flow conditions is expressed as T¼1 a2b/C0abL/C0ag/C0e/C0a(LþC)/C2/C3 , (11 :133) where the constant groups are defined as a¼2pRk vrCpsA, (11 :134) b¼aGcos (u), (11 :135) g¼/C0aT0, (11:136) and C¼/C01 aln (b/C0a2Ts/C0ag), (11 :137) where Tis temperature inside the pipe, Lis longitudinal distance from the fluid entry point, Ris inner radius of insulation layer, kis the thermal conductivity of the insulation material, vis the average flow velocity of fluid in the pipe, ris fluid density, Cpis heat capacity of fluid at constant pressure, sis thickness of the insulation layer, Ais the inner cross-sectional area of pipe, Gis principal thermal-gradient outside the insulation, uis the angle be- tween the principal thermal gradient and pipe orientation, T0is temperature of outer medium at the fluid entry location, and Tsis temperature of fluid at the fluid entry point.

Design base for a pipeline insulation ispresented in Table 11.6. The design criterion is to ensure that the temperature at any point in the pipeline will not drop to less than 25 8C, as required by flow assurance. Insulation materials considered for the project were polyethylene, polypropylene, and polyurethane. Solution A polyethylene layer of 0.0254 M (1 in.) was first considered as the insulation. Figure 11.13 shows the temperature profiles calculated using Eqs. (11.133) and (11.139). It indicates that at approximately 40 minutes after startup, the transient-temperature profile in the pipeline will approach the steady-flow temperature profile. The temperature at the end of the pipeline will be slightly lower than 20 8C under normal operating conditions. Obviously, this insulation option does not meet design criterion of 25 8C in the pipeline. Figure 11.14 presents the steady-flow temperature pro- files calculated using Eq. (11.133) with polyethylene layers of four thicknesses. It shows that even a polyethylene layer 0.0635-M (2.5-in.) thick will still not give a pipeline tem- perature higher than 25 8C; therefore, polyethylene should not be considered in this project. A polypropylene layer of 0.0254 M (1 in.) was then considered as the insulation. Figure 11.15 illustrates the temperature profiles calculated using Eq. (11.133) and (11.139). It again indicates that at approximately 40 min- utes after startup, the transient-temperature profile in the pipe will approach the steady-flow temperature profile. The temperature at the end of the pipeline will be approximately 22.5 8C under normal operating conditions. Obviously, this insulation option, again, does not meet design criterion of 25 8C in the pipeline. Figure 11.16 demonstrates the steady-flow temperature profiles calculated using Eq. (11.133) with polypropylene layers of four thicknesses. It shows that a polypropylene layer of 0.0508 M (2.0 in.) or thicker will give a pipeline temperature of higher than 25 8C. A polyurethane layer of 0.0254 M (1 in.) was also considered as the insulation. Figure 11.17 shows the tem- perature profiles calculated using Eqs. (11.133) and (11.139). It indicates that the temperature at the end of pipeline will drop to slightly lower than 25 8C under normal operating conditions. Figure 11.18 presents the steady-flow temperature profiles calculated using Eq. (11.133) with polyurethane layers of four thicknesses.

Therefore, either a polypropylene layer of 0.0508 M (2.0 in.) or a polyurethane layer of 0.0381 M (1.5 in.) should be chosen for insulation of the pipeline. Cost analyses can justify one of the options, which is beyond the scope of this example. The total heat losses for all the steady-flow cases were calculated with Eq. (11.138). The results are summarized inTable 11.7. These data may be used for sizing heaters for the pipeline if heating of the product fluid is necessary.

Oil reservoirs will eventually not be able to produce fluids at economical rates unless natural driving mechanisms (e.g., aquifer and/or gas cap) or pressure maintenance mechanisms (e.g., water flooding or gas injection) are present to maintain reservoir energy. The only way to obtain a high production rate of a well is to increase production pressure drawdown by reducing the bottom-hole pressure with artificial lift methods. Approximately 50% of wells worldwide need artificial lift systems. The commonly used artificial lift methods include the following: .Sucker rod pumping .Gas lift .Electrical submersible pumping .Hydraulic piston pumping .Hydraulic jet pumping .Plunger lift .Progressing cavity pumping Each method has applications for which it is the optimum installation. Proper selection of an artificial lift method for a given production system (reservoir and fluid properties, wellbore configuration, and surface facility restraints) requires a thorough understanding of the system. Economics analysis is always performed. Relative advantages and disadvantages of artificial lift systems are discussed in the beginning of each chapter in this part of this book. The chapters in this part provide production engineers with fundamentals of sucker rod pumping and gas lifts, as well as an introduction to other artificial lift systems. The following three chapters are included in this part of the book: Chapter 12: Sucker Rod Pumping Chapter 13: Gas Lift Chapter 14: Other Artificial Lift Methods12Sucker Rod Pumping Contents 12.1 Introduction 12/162 12.2 Pumping System 12/162 12.3 Polished Rod Motion 12/165 12.4 Load to the Pumping Unit 12/168 12.5 Pump Deliverability and Power Requirements 12/170 12.6 Procedure for Pumping Unit Selection 12/172 12.7 Principles of Pump Performance Analysis 12/174 Summary 12/179 References 12/179 Problems 12/17912.1 Introduction Sucker rod pumping is also referred to as ‘‘beam pump- ing.’’ It provides mechanical energy to lift oil from bottom hole to surface. It is efficient, simple, and easy for field people to operate. It can pump a well down to very low pressure to maximize oil production rate. It is applicable to slim holes, multiple completions, and high-temperature and viscous oils. The system is also easy to change to other wells with minimum cost. The major disadvantages of beam pumping include excessive friction in crooked/ deviated holes, solid-sensitive problems, low efficiency in gassy wells, limited depth due to rod capacity, and bulky in offshore operations. Beam pumping trends include improved pump-off controllers, better gas separation, gas handling pumps, and optimization using surface and bottom-hole cards. 12.2 Pumping System As shown in Fig. 12.1, a sucker rod pumping system consists of a pumping unit at surface and a plunger pump submerged in the production liquid in the well. The prime mover is either an electric motor or an in- ternal combustion engine. The modern method is to sup- ply each well with its own motor or engine. Electric motors are most desirable because they can easily be automated. The power from the prime mover is transmitted to the input shaft of a gear reducer by a V-belt drive . The output shaft of the gear reducer drives the crank arm at a lower speed ( /C244–40 revolutions per minute [rpm] depending on well characteristics and fluid properties). The rotary mo- tion of the crank arm is converted to an oscillatory motionby means of the walking beam through a pitman arm . The horse’s head and the hanger cable arrangement is used to ensure that the upward pull on the sucker rod string is vertical at all times (thus, no bending moment is applied to thestuffing box ). The polished rod and stuffing box com- bine to maintain a good liquid seal at the surface and, thus, force fluid to flow into the ‘‘T’’ connection just below the stuffing box. Conventional pumping units are available in a wide range of sizes, with stroke lengths varying from 12 to almost 200 in. The strokes for any pumping unit type are available in increments (unit size). Within each unit size, the stroke length can be varied within limits (about six different lengths being possible). These different lengths are achieved by varying the position of the pitman arm connection on the crank arm. Walking beam ratings are expressed in allowable pol- ished rod loads (PRLs) and vary from approximately 3,000 to 35,000 lb. Counterbalance for conventional pumping units is accomplished by placing weights directly on the beam (in smaller units) or by attaching weights to the rotating crank arm (or a combination of the two methods for larger units). In more recent designs, the rotary counterbalance can be adjusted by shifting the posi- tion of the weight on the crank by a jackscrew or rack and pinion mechanism. There are two other major types of pumping units. These are the Lufkin Mark II and the Air-Balanced Units (Fig. 12.2). The pitman arm and horse’s head are in the same side of the walking beam in these two types of units (Class III lever system). Instead of using counter-weights in Lufkin Mark II type units, air cylinders are used in the air- balanced units to balance the torque on the crankshaft.

For example, C- - -228D- - -200- - -74 : The first field is the code for type of pumping unit. Cis for conventional units, Ais for air-balanced units, Bis forbeam counterbalance units, and Mis for Mark II units. The second field is the code for peak torque rating in thousands of inch-pounds and gear reducer. Dstands for double-reduction gear reducer. The third field is the code for PRL rating in hundreds of pounds. The last field is the code for stroke length in inches.

The pump is installed in the tubing string below the dynamic liquid level. It consists of a working barrel andliner,standing valve (SV), and traveling valve (TV) at the bottom of the plunger , which is connected to sucker rods . As the plunger is moved downward by the sucker rod string, the TV is open, which allows the fluid to passthrough the valve, which lets the plunger move to a po- sition just above the SV. During this downward motion of the plunger, the SV is closed; thus, the fluid is forced to pass through the TV. When the plunger is at the bottom of the stroke and starts an upward stroke, the TV closes and the SV opens. As upward motion continues, the fluid in the well below the SV is drawn into the volume above the SV (fluid Tubing Sucker rods Working barrel and liner Traveling valve plunger Standing valve (a) (b) (c) (d) Figure 12.3 The pumping cycle: (a) plunger moving down, near the bottom of the stroke; (b) plunger moving up, near the bottom of the stroke; (c) plunger moving up, near the top of the stroke; (d) plunger moving down, near the top of the stroke (Nind, 1964).

The fluid continues to fill the volume above the SV until the plunger reaches the top of its stroke. There are two basic types of plunger pumps: tubing pump and rod pump (Fig. 12.4). For the tubing pump, the working barrel or liner (with the SV) is made up (i.e., attached) to the bottom of the production tubing string and must be run into the well with the tubing. The plunger (with the TV) is run into the well (inside the tubing) on the sucker rod string. Once the plunger is seated in the working barrel, pumping can be initiated. A rod pump (both working barrel and plunger) is run into the well on the sucker rod string and is seated on a wedged type seat that is fixed to the bottom joint of the production tubing. Plunger diameters vary from5⁄8to 45⁄8in. Plunger area varies from 0 :307 in :2to 17 :721 in :2. 12.3 Polished Rod Motion The theory of polished rod motion has been established since 1950s (Nind, 1964). Figure 12.5 shows the cyclic motion of a polished rod in its movements through the stuffing box of the conventional pumping unit and the air- balanced pumping unit. Conventional Pumping Unit . For this type of unit, the acceleration at the bottom of the stroke is somewhat greater than true simple harmonic acceleration. At the top of the stroke, it is less. This is a major drawback for the conventional unit. Just at the time the TV is closing and the fluid load is being transferred to the rods, the acceleration for the rods is at its maximum. These two factors combine to create a maximum stress on the rods that becomes one of the limiting factors in designing an installation. Table 12.1 shows dimensions of some APIconventional pumping units. Parameters are defined in Fig. 12.6. Air-Balanced Pumping Unit . For this type of unit, the maximum acceleration occurs at the top of the stroke (the acceleration at the bottom of the stroke is less than simple harmonic motion). Thus, a lower maximum stress is set up in the rod system during transfer of the fluid load to the rods. The following analyses of polished rod motion apply to conventional units. Figure 12.7 illustrates an approximate motion of the connection point between pitman arm and walking beam.

(12.12) occurs at the bottom of the stroke, and the acceleration defined in Eq. (12.9) occurs at the top. With the lever system of an air- balanced unit, the polished rod is at the top of its stroke when the crank arm is vertically upward (Fig. 12.5b). 12.4 Load to the Pumping Unit The load exerted to the pumping unit depends on well depth, rod size, fluid properties, and system dynamics. The maximum PRL and peak torque are major concerns for pumping unit. 12.4.1 Maximum PRL The PRL is the sum of weight of fluid being lifted, weight of plunger, weight of sucker rods string, dynamic load due to acceleration, friction force, and the up-thrust from below on plunger. In practice, no force attributable to fluid acceleration is required, so the acceleration terminvolves only acceleration of the rods. Also, the friction term and the weight of the plunger are neglected. We ignore the reflective forces, which will tend to underestimate the maximum PRL. To compensate for this, we set the up- thrust force to zero. Also, we assume the TV is closed at the instant at which the acceleration term reaches its maxi- mum. With these assumptions, the PRL maxbecomes PRL max¼Sf(62:4)D(Ap/C0Ar) 144þgsDA r 144 þgsDA r 144SN2M 70,471 :2/C18/C19 , (12 :13) where Sf¼specific gravity of fluid in tubing D¼length of sucker rod string (ft) Ap¼gross plunger cross-sectional area (in :2) Ar¼sucker rod cross-sectional area (in :2) gs¼specific weight of steel (490 lb =ft3) M¼Eq.

Thus, Eq. (12.17) becomes (where gs¼490) PRL max¼Sf(62:4)DA p 144/C00:1WrþWrþWrSN2M 70,471 :2/C18/C19 or PRL max¼Wfþ0:9WrþWrSN2M 70,471 :2/C18/C19 , (12 :18) where Wf¼Sf(62:4)DA p 144and is called the fluid load (not to be confused with the actual fluid weight on the rod string). Thus, Eq.

The minimum load is at or near the top of the stroke. Neglecting the weight of the plunger and friction term, the minimum PRL is PRL min¼/C0Sf(62:4)Wr gsþWr/C0WrF2, which, for 50 8API oil, reduces to PRL min¼0:9Wr/C0F2Wr¼(0:9/C0F2)Wr, (12 :22) where for the conventional units F2¼SN2(1/C0c h) 70,471 :2(12:23) and for air-balanced units F2¼SN2(1þc h) 70,471 :2: (12:24) 12.4.3 Counterweights To reduce the power requirements for the prime mover, a counterbalance load is used on the walking beam (small units) or the rotary crank. The ideal counterbalance load C is the average PRL. Therefore, C¼1 2(PRL maxþPRL min): Using Eqs. (12.19) and (12.22) in the above, we get C¼1 2Wfþ0:9Wrþ1 2(F1/C0F2)Wr (12:25) or for conventional units C¼1 2WfþWr0:9þSN2 70,471 :2c h/C18/C19 (12:26) and for air-balanced units C¼1 2WfþWr0:9/C0SN2 70,471 :2c h/C18/C19 : (12:27) The counterbalance load should be provided by structure unbalance and counterweights placed at walking beam (small units) or the rotary crank. The counterweights can be selected from manufacturer’s catalog based on the cal- culated Cvalue. The relationship between the counterbal- ance load Cand the total weight of the counterweights is C¼CsþWcr cd1 d2, where Cs¼structure unbalance, lb Wc¼total weight of counterweights, lb r¼distance between the mass center of counter- weights and the crank shaft center, in. 12.4.4 Peak Torque and Speed Limit The peak torque exerted is usually calculated on the most severe possible assumption, which is that the peak load (polished rod less counterbalance) occurs when the ef- fective crank length is also a maximum (when the crank arm is horizontal). Thus, peak torque Tis (Fig. 12.5) T¼cC/C0(0:9/C0F2)Wr ½/C138d2 d1: (12:28) Substituting Eq. (12.25) into Eq.

Torque factors are used for correc- tion: T¼1 2PRL max(TF1)þPRL min(TF2) ½/C138 0:93, (12 :31) where TF1¼maximum upstroke torque factor TF2¼maximum downstroke torque factor 0.93¼system efficiency. For symmetrical conventional and air-balanced units, TF¼TF1¼TF2. There is a limiting relationship between stroke length and cycles per minute. As given earlier, the maximum value of the downward acceleration (which occurs at the top of the stroke) is equal to amax =min¼SN2g1/C6c h/C0/C1 70,471 :2, (12 :32) (the +refers to conventional units or air-balanced units, see Eqs. [12.9] and [12.12]). If this maximum acceleration divided by gexceeds unity, the downward acceleration of the hanger is greater than the free-fall acceleration of the rods at the top of the stroke. This leads to severe pounding when the polished rod shoulder falls onto the hanger (leading to failure of the rod at the shoulder). Thus, a limit of the above downward acceleration term divided bygis limited to approximately 0.5 (or where Lis deter- mined by experience in a particular field).

Usually these are in sequences up to four different rod sizes. The tapered rod strings are designated by 1/8-in. (in diameter) increments. Taperedrod stringscanbeidentifiedbytheirnumberssuchas a.

Two criteria are used in the design of tapered rod strings: 1. Stress at the top rod of each rod size is the same throughout the string. 2. Stress in the top rod of the smallest (deepest) set of rods should be the highest ( /C2430,000 psi) and the stress pro- gressively decreases in the top rods of the higher sets of rods. The reason for the second criterion is that it is preferable that any rod breaks occur near the bottom of the string (otherwise macaroni).

What is the maximum allowable pumping speed if L¼0.4 is used? b. What is the expected maximum polished rod load? c. What is the expected peak torque? d.

Plunger motion depends on a number of factors including polished rod motion, sucker rod stretch, and12/170 ARTIFICIAL LIFT METHODStubing stretch. The theory in this subject has been well established (Nind, 1964). Two major sources of difference in the motion of the pol- ishedrodandtheplungerareelasticstretch(elongation)ofthe rod string and overtravel. Stretch is caused by the periodic transfer of the fluid load from the SV to the TV and back again. The result is a function of the stretch of the rod string and the tubing string. Rod string stretch is caused by the weight of the fluid column in the tubing coming on to the rod stringat the bottom of the strokewhenthe TV closes (this load is removed from the rod string at the top of the stroke whentheTVopens).Itisapparentthatthe plungerstrokewill be less than the polished rod stroke length Sby an amount equal to the rod stretch. The magnitude of the rod stretch is dlr¼WfDr ArE, (12:36) where Wf¼weight of fluid (lb) Dr¼length of rod string (ft) Ar¼cross-sectional area of rods (in :2) E¼modulus of elasticity of steel (30 /C2106lb=in:2). Tubing stretch can be expressed by a similar equation: dlt¼WfDt AtE(12:37)But because the tubing cross-sectional area Atis greater than the rod cross-sectional area Ar, the stretch of the tubing is small and is usually neglected. However, the tub- ing stretch can cause problems with wear on the casing. Thus, for this reason a tubing anchor is almost always used. Plunger overtravel at the bottom of the stroke is a result of the upward acceleration imposed on the downward- moving sucker rod elastic system. An approximation to the extent of the overtravel may be obtained by consider- ing a sucker rod string being accelerated vertically upward at a rate ntimes the acceleration of gravity. The vertical force required to supply this acceleration is nW r. The magnitude of the rod stretch due to this force is dlo¼nWrDr ArE(ft): (12:38) But the maximum acceleration term ncan be written as n¼SN21/C6c h/C0/C1 70,471 :2 so that Eq.

Metal-to-metal plungers are commonly available with plunger-to-barrel clearance on the diameter of /C00.001, /C00.002, /C00.003, /C00.004, and /C00.005 in. Such fits are re- ferred to as /C01,/C02,/C03,/C04, and /C05, meaning the plunger outside diameter is 0.001 in. smaller than the barrel inside diameter. In selecting a plunger, one must consider the viscosity of the oil to be pumped. A loose fit may be acceptable for a well with high viscosity oil (low 8API gravity). But such a loose fit in a well with low viscosity oil may be very inefficient. Guidelines are as follows: a. Low-viscosity oils (1–20 cps) can be pumped with a plunger to barrel fit of /C00.001 in. b. High-viscosity oils (7,400 cps) will probably carry sand in suspension so a plunger-to-barrel fit or approxi- mately 0.005 in. can be used. An empirical formula has been developed that can be used to calculate the slippage rate, qs(bbl/day), through the annulus between the plunger and the barrel: qs¼kp mdb/C0dp/C0/C12:9dbþdp/C0/C1 d0:1 bDp Lp, (12 :44) where kp¼a constant dp¼plunger outside diameter (in.) db¼barrel inside diameter (in.) Dp¼differential pressure drop across plunger (psi) Lp¼length of plunger (in.) m¼viscosity of oil (cp). The value of kpis 2:77/C2106to 6:36/C2106depending on field conditions. An average value is 4 :17/C2106. The value ofDpmay be estimated on the basis of well productivityindex and production rate. A reasonable estimate may be a value that is twice the production drawdown. Volumetric efficiency can decrease significantly due to the presence of free gas below the plunger. As the fluid is elevated and gas breaks out of solution, there is a significant difference between the volumetric displace- ment of the bottom-hole pump and the volume of the fluid delivered to the surface. This effect is denoted by the shrinkage factor greater than 1.0, indicating that the bottom-hole pump must displace more fluid by some additional percentage than the volume delivered to the surface (Brown, 1980). The effect of gas on volumetric efficiency depends on solution–gas ratio and bottom-hole pressure. Down-hole devices, called ‘‘gas anchors,’’ are usually installed on pumps to separate the gas from the liquid. In summary, volumetric efficiency is mainly affected by the slippage of oil and free gas volume below plunger. Both effects are difficult to quantify. Pump efficiency can vary over a wide range but are commonly 70–80%. 12.5.3 Power Requirements The prime mover should be properly sized to provide adequate power to lift the production fluid, to overcome friction loss in the pump, in the rod string and polished rod, and in the pumping unit. The power required for lifting fluid is called ‘‘hydraulic power.’’ It is usually ex- pressed in terms of net lift: Ph¼7:36/C210/C06qglLN, (12 :45) where Ph¼hydraulic power, hp q¼liquid production rate, bbl/day gl¼liquid specific gravity, water ¼1 LN¼net lift, ft, and LN¼Hþptf 0:433gl, (12 :46) where H¼depth to the average fluid level in the annulus, ft ptf¼flowing tubing head pressure, psig. The power required to overcome friction losses can be empirically estimated as Pf¼6:31/C210/C07WrSN: (12:47) Thus, the required prime mover power can be expressed as Ppm¼Fs(PhþPf), (12 :48) where Fsis a safety factor of 1.25–1.50. Example Problem 12.2 A well is pumped off (fluid level is the pump depth) with a rod pump described in Example Problem 12.1. A 3-in. tubing string (3.5-in. OD, 2.995 ID) in the well is not anchored. Calculate (a) expected liquid production rate (use pump volumetric efficiency 0.8), and (b) required prime mover power (use safety factor 1.35).

Figure 12.9 shows a sche- matic of a pump dynagraph. This instrument is installed immediately above the plunger to record the plunger stroke and the loads carried by the plunger during the pump cycle. The relative motion between the cover tube (which is attached to the pump barrel and hence anchored to the tubing) and the calibrated rod (which is an integral part of the sucker rod string) is recorded as a horizontal line on the recording tube. This is achieved by having the record- ing tube mounted on a winged nut threaded onto the calibrated rod and prevented from rotating by means of 05001,0001,5002,0002,500 0 2,000 4,000 6,000 8,000 10,000 12,000 Pump Settin g Depth (ft)Pump Displacement (bbl/day)A B C D E F G HCurve API size Stroke 34 42 48 54 64 74 84 14440 57 80 114 160 228 320  640 Figure 12.8 Sucker rod pumping unit selection chart (Kelley and Willis, 1954).12/174 ARTIFICIAL LIFT METHODSTable 12.4 Design Data for API Sucker Rod Pumping Units (a) Size 40 unit with 34-in. stroke Pump depth (ft)Plunger size(in.)Tubing size(in.)Rod sizes (in.)Pumping speed (stroke/min) 1,000–1,100 23⁄4 37⁄8 24–19 1,100–1,250 21⁄2 37⁄8 24–19 1,250–1,650 21⁄4 21⁄23⁄4 24–19 1,650–1,900 2 21⁄23⁄4 24–19 1,900–2,150 13⁄4 21⁄23⁄4 24–19 2,150–3,000 11⁄2 25⁄8–3⁄4 24–19 3,000–3,700 11⁄4 25⁄8–3⁄5 22–18 3,700–4,000 1 25⁄8–3⁄6 21–18 (b) Size 57 unit with 42-in. stroke Pump depth (ft)Plunger size(in.)Tubing size(in.)Rod sizes (in.)Pumping speed (stroke/min) 1,150–1,300 23⁄4 37⁄8 24–19 1,300–1,450 21⁄2 37⁄8 24–19 1,450–1,850 21⁄4 21⁄23⁄4 24–19 1,850–2,200 2 21⁄23⁄4 24–19 2,200–2,500 13⁄4 21⁄23⁄4 24–19 2,500–3,400 11⁄2 25⁄8–3⁄4 23–18 3,400–4,200 11⁄4 25⁄8–3⁄5 22–17 4,200–5,000 1 25⁄8–3⁄6 21–17 (c) Size 80 unit with 48-in. stroke Pump depth (ft)Plunger size(in.)Tubing size(in.)Rod sizes (in.)Pumping speed (stroke/min) 1,400–1,500 23⁄4 37⁄8 24–19 1,550–1,700 21⁄2 37⁄8 24–19 1,700–2,200 21⁄4 21⁄23⁄4 24–19 2,200–2,600 2 21⁄23⁄4 24–19 2,600–3,000 13⁄4 21⁄23⁄4 23–18 3,000–4,100 11⁄2 25⁄8–3⁄4 23–19 4,100–5,000 11⁄4 25⁄8–3⁄5 21–17 5,000–6,000 1 25⁄8–3⁄6 19–17 (d) Size 114 unit with 54-in. stroke Pump depth (ft)Plunger size(in.)Tubing size(in.)Rod sizes (in.)Pumping speed (stroke/min) 1,700–1,900 23⁄4 37⁄8 24–19 1,900–2,100 21⁄2 37⁄8 24–19 2,100–2,700 21⁄4 21⁄23⁄4 24–19 2,700–3,300 2 21⁄23⁄4 23–18 3,300–3,900 13⁄4 21⁄23⁄4 22–17 3,900–5,100 11⁄2 25⁄8–3⁄4 21–17 5,100–6,300 11⁄4 25⁄8–3⁄5 19–16 6,300–7,000 1 25⁄8–3⁄6 17–16 (e) Size 160 unit with 64-in. stroke Pump depth (ft)Plunger size(in.)Tubing size(in.)Rod sizes (in.)Pumping speed (stroke/min) 2,000–2,200 23⁄4 37⁄8 24–19 2,200–2,400 21⁄2 37⁄8 24–19 2,400–3,000 21⁄4 21⁄23⁄4–7⁄8 24–19 3,000–3,600 2 21⁄23⁄4–7⁄8 23–18 3,600–4,200 13⁄4 21⁄23⁄4–7⁄8 22–17 4,200–5,400 11⁄2 25⁄8–3⁄4–7⁄8 21–17 5,400–6,700 11⁄4 25⁄8–3⁄4–7⁄8 19–15 6,700–7,700 1 25⁄8–3⁄4–7⁄8 17–15SUCKER ROD PUMPING 12/175(f) Size 228 unit with 74-in. stroke Pump depth (ft)Plunger size(in.)Tubing size(in.)Rod sizes (in.)Pumping speed (stroke/min) 2,400–2,600 23⁄4 37⁄8 24–20 2,600–3,000 21⁄2 37⁄8 23–18 3,000–3,700 21⁄4 21⁄23⁄4–7⁄8 22–17 3,700–4,500 2 21⁄23⁄4–7⁄8 21–16 4,500–5,200 13⁄4 21⁄23⁄4–7⁄8 19–15 5,200–6,800 11⁄2 25 =8- - -3⁄4–7⁄8 18–14 6,800–8,000 11⁄4 25 =8- - -3⁄4–7⁄8 16–13 8,000–8,500 11 =16 2 5 =8- - -3⁄4–7⁄8 14–13 (g) Size 320 unit with 84-in. stroke Pump depth (ft)Plunger size(in.)Tubing size(in.)Rod sizes (in.)Pumping speed (stroke/min) 2,800–3,200 23⁄4 37⁄8 23–18 3,200–3,600 21⁄2 37⁄8 21–17 3,600–4,100 21⁄4 21⁄23⁄4–7⁄8---1 21–17 4,100–4,800 2 21⁄23⁄4–7⁄8---1 20–16 4,800–5,600 13⁄4 21⁄23⁄4–7⁄8---1 19–16 5,600–6,700 11⁄2 21⁄23⁄4–7⁄8---1 18–15 6,700–8,000 11⁄4 21⁄23⁄4–7⁄8---1 17–13 8,000–9,500 11 =16 21⁄23⁄4–7⁄8---1 14–11 (h) Size 640 unit with 144-in. stroke Pump depth (ft)Plunger size(in.)Tubing size(in.)Rod sizes (in.)Pumping speed (stroke/min) 3,200–3,500 23⁄4 37⁄8–1 18–14 3,500–4,000 21⁄2 37⁄8–1 17–13 4,000–4,700 21⁄4 21⁄23⁄4–7⁄8---1 16–13 4,700–5,700 2 21⁄23⁄4–7⁄8---1 15–12 5,700–6,600 13⁄4 21⁄23⁄4–7⁄8---1 14–12 6,600–8,000 11⁄2 21⁄23⁄4–7⁄8---1 14–11 8,000–9,600 11⁄4 21⁄23⁄4–7⁄8---1 13–10 9,600–11,000 11 =16 21⁄23⁄4–7⁄8---1 12–10 Sucker rod string Self-aligning bear Lugs Rotating tube with spiral grooves Cover tube with vertical grooves Recording tube Winged nut Stylus LugsTubing Calibrated rod Plunger assembly Pump liner Figure 12.9 A sketch of pump dynagraph (Nind, 1964).12/176 ARTIFICIAL LIFT METHODStwo lugs, which are attached to the winged nut, which run in vertical grooves in the cover tube. The stylus is mounted on a third tube, which is free to rotate and is connected by a self-aligning bearing to the upper end of the calibrated rod. Lugs attached to the cover tube run in spiral grooves cut in the outer surface of the rotating tube. Consequently, vertical motion of the plunger assembly relative to the barrel results in rotation of the third tube, and the stylus cuts a horizontal line on a recording tube. Any change in plunger loading causes a change in length of the section of the calibrated rod between the winged nut supporting the recording tube and the self-aligning bearing supporting the rotating tube (so that a vertical line is cut on the recording tube by the stylus). When the pump is in operation, the stylus traces a series of cards, one on top of the other. To obtain a new series of cards, the polished rod at the well head is rotated. This rotation is transmitted to the plunger in a few pump strokes. Because the recording tube is prevented from rotating by the winged nut lugs that run in the cover tube grooves, the rotation of the sucker rod string causes the winged nut to travel—upward or downward depending on the direction of rotation—on the threaded calibrated rod. Upon the completion of a series of tests, the recording tube (which is 36 in. long) is removed. It is important to note that although the bottom-hole dynagraph records the plunger stroke and variations in plunger loading, no zero line is obtained. Thus, quantita- tive interpretation of the cards becomes somewhat specu- lative unless a pressure element is run with the dynagraph. Figure 12.10 shows some typical dynagraph card results. Card (a) shows an ideal case where instantaneous valve actions at the top and bottom of the stroke are indicated. In general, however, some free gas is drawn into the pump on the upstroke, so a period of gas compression can occur on the down-stroke before the TV opens. This is shown in card (b). Card (c) shows gas expansion during the upstroke giving a rounding of the card just as the upstroke begins. Card (d) shows fluid pounding that occurs when the well is almost pumped off (the pump displacement rate is higher than the formation of potential liquid production rate). This fluid pounding results in a rapid fall off in stress in the rod string and the sudden imposed shock to the system. Card (e) shows that the fluid pounding has progressed so that the mechanical shock causes oscillations in the sys- tem. Card (f) shows that the pump is operating at a very low volumetric efficiency where almost all the pump stroke is being lost in gas compression and expansion (no liquid is being pumped). This results in no valve action and the area between the card nearly disappears (thus, is gas locked). Usually, this gas-locked condition is only temporary, and as liquid leaks past the plunger, the volume of liquid in the pump barrel increases until the TV opens and pumping recommences.The use of the pump dynagraph involves pulling the rods and pump from the well bath to install the instrument and to recover the recording tube. Also, the dynagraph cannot be used in a well equipped with a tubing pump. Thus, the dynagraph is more a research instrument than an operational device. Once there is knowledge from a dyna- graph, surface dynamometer cards can be interpreted. The surface, or polished rod, dynamometer is a device that records the motion of (and its history) the polished rod during the pumping cycle. The rod string is forced by the pumping unit to follow a regular time versus position pattern. However, the polished rod reacts with the load- ings (on the rod string) that are imposed by the well. The surface dynamometer cards record the history of the variations in loading on the polished rod during a cycle. The cards have three principal uses: a. To obtain information that can be used to determine load, torque, and horsepower changes required of the pump equipment b. To improve pump operating conditions such as pump speed and stroke length c. To check well conditions after installation of equipment to prevent or diagnose various operating problems (like pounding, etc.) Surface instruments can be mechanical, hydraulic, and electrical. One of the most common mechanical instru- ments is a ring dynamometer installed between the hanger bar and the polished rod clamp in such a manner as the ring may carry the entire well load. The deflection of the ring is proportional to the load, and this deflection is amplified and transmitted to the recording arm by a series of levers. A stylus on the recording arm traces a record of the imposed loads on a waxed (or via an ink pen) paper card located on a drum. The loads are obtained in terms of polished rod displacements by having the drum oscillate back and forth to reflect the polished rod motion. Correct interpretation of surface dynamometer card leads to esti- mate of various parameter values. .Maximum and minimum PRLs can be read directly from the surface card (with the use of instrument cali- bration). These data then allow for the determination of the torque, counterbalance, and horsepower require- ments for the surface unit. .Rod stretch and contraction is shown on the surface dynamometer card. This phenomenon is reflected in the surface unit dynamometer card and is shown in Fig. 12.11a for an ideal case. .Acceleration forces cause the ideal card to rotate clock- wise. The PRL is higher at the bottom of the stroke and lower at the top of the stroke. Thus, in Fig. 12.11b, Point A is at the bottom of the stroke. Figure 12.10 Pump dynagraph cards: (a) ideal card, (b) gas compression on down-stroke, (c) gas expansion on upstroke, (d) fluid pound, (e) vibration due to fluid pound, (f) gas lock (Nind, 1964).SUCKER ROD PUMPING 12/177.Rod vibration causes a serious complication in the in- terpretation of the surface card. This is result of the closing of the TV and the ‘‘pickup’’ of the fluid load by the rod string. This is, of course, the fluid pounding. This phenomenon sets up damped oscillation (longitu- dinal and bending) in the rod string. These oscillations result in waves moving from one end of the rod string to the other. Because the polished rod moves slower near the top and bottom of the strokes, these stress (or load) fluctuations due to vibrations tend to show up more prominently at those locations on the cards. Figure 12.11c shows typical dynamometer card with vibrations of the rod string.Figure 12.12 presents a typical chart from a strain-gage type of dynamometer measured for a conventional unit operated with a 74-in. stroke at 15.4 strokes per minute. It shows the history of the load on the polished rod as a function of time (this is for a well 825 ft in depth with a No. 86 three-tapered rod string). Figure 12.13 reproduces the data in Fig. 12.12 in a load versus displacement dia- gram. In the surface chart, we can see the peak load of 22,649 lb (which is 28,800 psi at the top of the 1-in. rod) in Fig. 12.13a. In Fig. 12.13b, we see the peak load of 17,800 lb (which is 29,600 psi at the top of the7⁄8-in. rod). In Fig. 12.13c, we see the peak load of 13,400 lb (which is 30,300 psi at the top of the3⁄4-in. rod).

The negative in Fig. 12.13d is the buoyancy of the rod string. The information derived from the dynamometer card (dynagraph) can be used for evaluation of pump perfor- mance and troubleshooting of pumping systems. This sub- ject is thoroughly addressed by Brown (1980).\\\\ Summary This chapter presents the principles of sucker rod pumping systems and illustrates a procedure for selecting components of rod pumping systems.

Upon entering the tubing, the com- pressed gas affects liquid flow in two ways: (a) the energy of expansion propels (pushes) the oil to the surface and (b) the gas aerates the oil so that the effective density of the fluid is less and, thus, easier to get to the surface. There are four categories of wells in which a gas lift can be considered: 1. High productivity index (PI), high bottom-hole pres- sure wells 2. High PI, low bottom-hole pressure wells 3. Low PI, high bottom-hole pressure wells 4. Low PI, low bottom-hole pressure wells Wells having a PI of 0.50 or less are classified as low productivity wells. Wells having a PI greater than 0.50 are classified as high productivity wells. High bottom-hole pressures will support a fluid column equal to 70% of the well depth. Low bottom-hole pressures will support a fluid column less than 40% of the well depth. Gas lift technology has been widely used in the oil fields that produce sandy and gassy oils. Crooked/deviated holes present no problem. Well depth is not a limitation. It is also applicable to offshore operations. Lifting costs for a large number of wells are generally very low. However, it requires lift gas within or near the oil fields. It is usually not efficient in lifting small fields with a small number of wells if gas compression equipment is required. Gas lift advancements in pressure control and automation systems have enabled the optimization of individual wells and gas lift systems. 13.2 Gas Lift System A complete gas lift system consists of a gas compression station, a gas injection manifold with injection chokes and time cycle surface controllers, a tubing string with instal- lations of unloading valves and operating valve, and a down-hole chamber. Figure 13.1 depicts a configuration of a gas-lifted well with installations of unloading valves and operating valveon the tubing string. There are four principal advantages to be gained by the use of multiple valves in a well: 1. Deeper gas injection depths can be achieved by using valves for wells with fixed surface injection pressures. 2. Variation in the well’s productivity can be obtained by selectively injecting gas valves set at depths ‘‘higher’’ or ‘‘lower’’ in the tubing string. 3. Gas volumes injected into the well can be ‘‘metered’’ into the well by the valves. 4. Intermittent gas injection at progressively deeper set valves can be carried out to ‘‘kick off’’ a well to either continuous or intermittent flow. A continuous gas lift operation is a steady-state flow of the aerated fluid from the bottom (or near bottom) of the well to the surface. Intermittent gas lift operation is char- acterized by a start-and-stop flow from the bottom (or near bottom) of the well to the surface. This is unsteady state flow . In continuous gas lift, a small volume of high-pressure gas is introduced into the tubing to aerate or lighten the fluid column. This allows the flowing bottom-hole pres- sure with the aid of the expanding injection gas to deliver liquid to the surface. To accomplish this efficiently, it is desirable to design a system that will permit injection through a single valve at the greatest depth possible with the available injection pressure. Continuous gas lift method is used in wells with a high PI ( /C210:5 stb =day=psi) and a reasonably high reser- voir pressure relative to well depth. Intermittent gas lift method is suitable to wells with (1) high PI and low reservoir pressure or (2) low PI and low reservoir pressure. The type of gas lift operation used, continuous or intermittent, is also governed by the volume of fluids to be produced, the available lift gas as to both volume and pressure, and the well reservoir’s conditions such as the case when the high instantaneous BHP drawdown encountered with intermittent flow would cause exces- sive sand production, or coning, and/or gas into the wellbore. Figure 13.2 illustrates a simplified flow diagram of a closed rotary gas lift system for a single well in an intermittent gas lift operation. The time cycle surface controller regulates the start-and-stop injection of lift gas to the well. For proper selection, installation, and operations of gas lift systems, the operator must know the equipment and the fundamentals of gas lift technology. The basic equip- ment for gas lift technology includes the following: a. Main operating valves b. Wire-line adaptations c. Check valves d. Mandrels e. Surface control equipment f. Compressors This chapter covers basic system engineering design fun- damentals for gas lift operations. Relevant topics include the following: 1. Liquid flow analysis for evaluation of gas lift potential 2. Gas flow analysis for determination of lift gas compres- sion requirements 3. Unloading process analysis for spacing subsurface valves 4. Valve characteristics analysis for subsurface valve selection 5. Installation design for continuous and intermittent lift systems.Operating valveUnloading valvesGas inletProduction Figure 13.1 Configuration of a typical gas lift well.13/182 ARTIFICIAL LIFT METHODS13.3 Evaluation of Gas Lift Potential Continuous gas lift can be satisfactorily applied to most wells having a reasonable degree of bottom-hole maintenance and a PI of approximately 0.5 bbl/day/psi or greater. A PI as low as 0.2 bbl/day/psi can be used for a continuous gas lift operation if injection gas is available at a sufficiently high pressure. An intermittent gas lift is usually applied to wells having a PI less than 0.5 bbl/day/psi. Continuous gas lift wells are changed to intermittent gas lift wells after reservoir pressures drop to below a certain level. Therefore, intermittent gas lift wells usually give lower production rates than continuous gas lift wells. The decision of whether to use gas lift technology for oil well production starts from evaluating gas lift potential with continuous gas injection. Evaluation of gas lift potential requires system analyses to determine well operating points for various lift gas availabilities. The principle is based on the fact that there is only one pressure at a given point (node) in any system; no matter, the pressure is estimated based on the informa- tion from upstream (inflow) or downstream (outflow). The node of analysis is usually chosen to be the gas injection point inside the tubing, although bottom hole is often used as a solution node. The potential of gas lift wells is controlled by gas injec- tion rate or gas liquid ratio (GLR). Four gas injection rates are significant in the operation of gas lift installations: 1. Injection rates of gas that result in no liquid (oil or water) flow up the tubing. The gas amount is insuffi- cient to lift the liquid. If the gas enters the tubing at an extremely low rate, it will rise to the surface in small semi-spheres (bubbly flow). 2. Injection rates of maximum efficiency where a min- imum volume of gas is required to lift a given amount of liquid. 3. Injection rate for maximum liquid flow rate at the ‘‘optimum GLR.’’ 4. Injection rate of no liquid flow because of excessive gas injection. This occurs when the friction (pipe) produced by the gas prevents liquid from entering the tubing.Figure 13.3 depicts a continuous gas lift operation. The tubing is filled with reservoir fluid below the injection point and with the mixture of reservoir fluid and injected gas above the injection point. The pressure relationship is shown in Fig. 13.4. The inflow performance curve for the node at the gas injection point inside the tubing is well IPR curve minus the pressure drop from bottom hole to the node. The outflow performance curve is the vertical lift performance curve, with total GLR being the sum of formation GLR and injected GLR. Intersection of the two curves defines the operation point, that is, the well production potential.Compressor stationSuction regulator High pressure systemBy-pass regulatorStock tankIntermittent gas lift wellFlowline Separator Vent or sales line regulator Low pressure system Make-up gas line for charging systemInjection gas lineTime cycle surface controlle r Figure 13.2 A simplified flow diagram of a closed rotary gas lift system for single intermittent well.

If only a limited amount of gas is available for the gas lift, the gas should be distributed to individual wells based on predicted well lifting perfor- mance, that is, the wells that will produce oil at higher rates at a given amount of lift gas are preferably chosen to receive more lift gas. If an unlimited amount of gas lift gas is available for a well, the well should receive a lift gas injection rate that yields the optimum GLR in the tubing so that the flowing bottom-hole pressure is minimized, and thus, oil produc- tion is maximized. The optimum GLR is liquid flow rate dependent and can be found from traditional gradient curves such as those generated by Gilbert (Gilbert, 1954). Similar curves can be generated with modern computer programs using various multiphase correlations. The com- puter program OptimumGLR.xls in the CD attached to this book was developed based on modified Hagedorn and Brown method (Brown, 1977) for multiphase flow calcu- lations and the Chen method (1979) for friction factor determination. It can be used for predicting the optimum GLR in tubing at a given tubing head pressure and liquid flow rate. After the system analysis is completed with the optimum GLRs in the tubing above the injection point, the expected liquid production rate (well potential) is known. The required injection GLR to the well can be calculated by GLR inj¼GLR opt,o/C0GLR fm, (13 :1) where GLR inj¼injection GLR, scf/stb GLR opt,o¼optimum GLR at operating flow rate, scf/stb GLR fm¼formation oil GLR, scf/stb. Then the required gas injection rate to the well can be calculated byqg,inj¼GLR injqo, (13 :2) where qois the expected operating liquid flow rate. If a limited amount of gas lift gas is available for a well, the well potential should be estimated based on GLR expressed as GLR ¼GLR fmþqg,inj q, (13 :3) where qgis the lift gas injection rate (scf/day) available to the well. Example Problem 13.1 An oil well has a pay zone around the mid-perf depth of 5,200 ft. The formation oil has a gravity of 26 8API and GLR of 300 scf/stb. Water cut remains 0%.

Solution The maximum oil production rate is expected when the gas injection point is set right above the packer.

These gas flow rates and output pressures deter- mine the required power of the compression station. 13.4.1 Gas Flow Rate Requirement The total gas flow rate of the compression station should be designed on the basis of gas lift at peak operating condition for all the wells with a safety factor for system leak consideration, that is, qg,total¼SfXNw i¼1qg,inj/C0/C1 i, (13 :4) where qg¼total output gas flow rate of the compression station, scf/day Sf¼safety factor, 1.05 or higher Nw¼number of wells. The procedure for determination of lift gas injection rateqg,injto each well has been illustrated in Example Prob- lem 13.1. 13.4.2 Output Gas Pressure Requirement Kickoff of a dead well (non-natural flowing) requires much higher compressor output pressures than the ulti- mate goal of steady production (either by continuous gas lift or by intermittent gas lift operations). Mobil compressor trailers are used for the kickoff operations. The output pressure of the compression station should be designed on the basis of the gas distribution pressure under normal flow conditions, not the kickoff conditions. It can be expressed as pout¼SfpL, (13:5) where pout¼output pressure of the compression station, psia Sf¼safety factor pL¼pressure at the inlet of the gas distribution line, psia. Starting from the tubing pressure at the valve ( pt,v), the pressure at the inlet of the gas distribution line can be estimated based on the relationships of pressures along the injection path. These relationships are discussed in the following subsections. 13.4.2.1 Injection Pressure at Valve Depth The injection pressure at valve depth in the casing side can be expressed as pc,v¼pt,vþDpv, (13 :6) where pc,v¼casing pressure at valve depth, psia Dpv¼pressure differential across the operating valve (orifice). It is a common practice to use Dpv¼100 psi. The required size of the orifice can be determined using the choke-flow equations presented in Subsection 13.4.2.3. 13.4.2.2 Injection Pressure at Surface Accurate determination of the surface injection pressure pc,srequires rigorous methods such as the Cullender andq(stb/d) GLR opt(scf/stb) 400 4,500 600 3,200 800 2,400 q(stb/day) pt(psia) 400 603 600 676 800 752 q(stb/day) GLR (scf/stb) 400 2,800 600 1,967 800 1,550 q(stb/day) pt(psia) 400 614 600 694 800 774GAS LIFT 13/185Smith method (Katz et al., 1959). The average temperature and compressibility factor method also gives results with acceptable accuracy. In both methods, the frictional pressure losses in the annulus are considered. However, because of the large cross-sectional area of the annular space, the frictional pressure losses are often negligible. Then the average temperature and compressibility factor model degenerates to (Economides et al., 1994) pc,v¼pc,se0:01875ggDv /C22z z/C22T T,(13:7) where pc,v¼casing pressure at valve depth, psia pc,s¼casing pressure at surface, psia gg¼gas specific gravity, air ¼1:0/C22z z¼the average gas compressibility factor /C22T T¼the average temperature, 8R. Equation (13.7) can be rearranged to be pc,s¼pc,ve/C00:01875ggDv /C22z z/C22T T: (13:8) Since the zfactor also depends on pc,s, this equation can be solved for pc,swith a trial-and-error approach. Because Eq. (13.8) involves exponential function that is difficult to handle without a calculator, an approximation to the equation has been used traditionally. In fact, when Eq. (13.7) is expended as a Taylor series, and if common fluid properties for a natural gas and reservoir are consid- ered such as gg¼0:7,/C22z z¼0:9, and /C22T T¼6008R, it can be approximated as−50005001,0001,5002,0002,500 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 Liquid Flow Rate (stb/day)Tubing Pressure at the Injection Depth (psia)Inflow Pressure (psia) Outflow Pressure (psia) Figure 13.5 System analysis plot given by GasLiftPotential.xls for the unlimited gas injection case. −50005001,0001,5002,0002,500 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 Liquid Flow Rate (stb/day)Tubing Pressure at the Injection Depth (psia)Inflow Pressure (psia) Outflow Pressure (psia) Figure 13.6 System analysis plot given by GasLiftPotential.xls for the limited gas injection case.13/186 ARTIFICIAL LIFT METHODSpc,v¼pc,s1þDv 40,000/C18/C19 , (13 :9) which gives pc,s¼pc,v 1þDv 40,000:(13:10) Neglecting the pressure losses between injection choke and the casing head, the pressure downstream of the choke (pdn) can be assumed to be the casing surface injection pressure, that is, pdn¼pc,s: 13.4.2.3 Pressure Upstream of the Choke The pressure upstream of the injection choke depends on flow condition at the choke, that is, sonic or subsonic flow. Whether a sonic flow exists depends on a downstream-to- upstream pressure ratio. If this pressure ratio is less than a critical pressure ratio, sonic (critical) flow exists. If this pressure ratio is greater than or equal to the critical pres- sure ratio, subsonic (subcritical) flow exists. The critical pressure ratio through chokes is expressed as Rc¼2 kþ1/C18/C19 k k/C01 , (13 :11) where k¼Cp=Cvis the gas-specific heat ratio. The value of the kis about 1.28 for natural gas. Thus, the critical pressure ratio is about 0.55. Pressure equations for choke flow are derived based on an isentropic process. This is because there is no time for heat to transfer (adiabatic) and the friction loss is negli- gible (assuming reversible) at choke. 13.4.2.3.1 Sonic Flow Under sonic flow conditions, the gas passage rate reaches and remains its maximum value. The gas passage rate is expressed in the following equation for ideal gases: qgM¼879CcApupﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ k ggTup ! 2 kþ1/C18/C19 kþ1 k/C01vuut, (13 :12) where qgM¼gas flow rate, Mscf/day pup¼pressure upstream the choke, psia A¼cross-sectional area of choke, in :2 Tup¼upstream temperature, 8R gg¼gas specific gravity related to air Cc¼choke flow coefficient.

Equation (13.12) indicates that the upstream pressure is independent of downstream pressure under sonic flow conditions. If it is desirable to make a choke work under sonic flow conditions, the upstream pressure should meet the following condition: pup/C21pdn 0:55¼1:82pdn (13:15) Once the pressure upstream of the choke/orifice is deter- mined by Eq. (13.15), the required choke/orifice diameter can be calculated with Eq. (13.12) using a trial-and-error approach. 13.4.2.3.2 Subsonic Flow Under subsonic flow con- ditions, gas passage through a choke can be expressed as qgM¼1,248 CcApup /C2ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ k (k/C01)ggTuppdn pup/C18/C19 2 k /C0pdn pup/C18/C19 kþ1 k\"#vuut: (13:16) If it is desirable to make a choke work under subsonic flow conditions, the upstream pressure should be determined from Eq.

The solution given by the program to this example problem is shown in Table 13.1. 13.4.3 Compression Power Requirement The compressors used in the petroleum industry fall into two distinct categories: reciprocating and rotary compres- sors. Reciprocating compressors are built for practically all pressures and volumetric capacities. Reciprocating compressors have more moving parts and, therefore, lower mechanical efficiencies than rotary compressors. Each cylinder assembly of a reciprocation compressor consists of a piston, cylinder, cylinder heads, suction and discharge valves, and other parts necessary to convertrotary motion to reciprocation motion. A reciprocating compressor is designed for a certain range of compression ratios through the selection of proper piston displacement and clearance volume within the cylinder. This clearance volume can be either fixed or variable, depending on the extent of the operation range and the percent of load variation desired. A typical reciprocating compressor can deliver a volumetric gas flow rate up to 30,000 cubic feet per minute (cfm) at a discharge pressure up to 10,000 psig. Rotary compressors are divided into two classes: the centrifugal compressor and the rotary blower. A centri- fugal compressor consists of a housing with flow passages, a rotating shaft on which the impeller is mounted, bearings, and seals to prevent gas from escaping along the shaft. Centrifugal compressors have few moving parts because only the impeller and shaft rotate. Thus, its efficiency is high and lubrication oil consumption and maintenance costs are low. Cooling water is normally unnecessary because of lower compression ratio and lower friction loss. Compression rates of centrifugal compressors are lower because of the absence of positive displacement. Centrifugal compressors compress gas using centrifugal force. Work is done on the gas by an impeller. Gas is then discharged at a high velocity into a diffuser where the velocity is reduced and its kinetic energy is converted to static pressure. Unlike reciprocating compressors, all this is done without confinement and physical squeezing. Centri- fugal compressors with relatively unrestricted passages and continuous flow are inherently high-capacity, low-pressure ratio machines that adapt easily to series arrangements within a station. In this way, each compressor is required to develop only part of the station compression ratio. Typically, the volume is more than 100,000 cfm and dis- charge pressure is up to 100 psig. When selecting a compressor, the pressure-volume char- acteristics and the type of driver must be considered.

Large-volume positive compres- sors operate at lower speeds and are usually driven by steam or gas engines. They may be driven through reduc- tion gearing by steam turbines or an electric motor. Re- ciprocation compressors driven by steam turbines or electric motors are most widely used in the petroleum industry as the conventional high-speed compression ma- chine. Selection of compressors requires considerations of volumetric gas deliverability, pressure, compression ratio, and horsepower. 13.4.3.1 Reciprocating Compressors Two basic approaches are used to calculate the horse- power theoretically required to compress natural gas. One is to use analytical expressions. In the case of adiabatic compression, the relationships are complicated and are usually based on the ideal-gas equation. When used for real gases where deviation from ideal-gas law is appre- ciable, they are empirically modified to take into consid- eration the gas deviation factor. The second approach is the enthalpy-entropy or Mollier diagram for real gases. This diagram provides a simple, direct, and rigorous pro- cedure for determining the horsepower theoretically neces- sary to compress the gas. Even though in practice the cylinders in the reciprocating compressors may be water-cooled, it is customary to con- sider the compression process as fundamentally adiabatic— that is, to idealize the compression as one in which there is no cooling of the gas. Furthermore, the process is usually considered to be essentially a perfectly reversible adiabatic, that is, an isentropic process. Thus, in analyzing the performance of a typical reciprocating compressor, one may look upon the compression path following the general law pVk¼a constant : (13:19) For real natural gases in the gravity range 0 :55<gg<1, the following relationship can be used at approximately 1508F: k150/C14F/C252:738/C0loggg 2:328(13:20) When a real gas is compressed in a single-stage compres- sion, the compression is polytropic tending to approach adiabatic or constant-entropy conditions. Adiabatic com- pression calculations give the maximum theoretical work orhorsepower necessary to compress a gas between any two pressure limits, whereas isothermal compression cal- culations give the minimum theoretical work or horse- power necessary to compress a gas. Adiabatic and isothermal work of compression, thus, give the upper and lower limits, respectively, of work or horsepower requirements to compress a gas. One purpose of intercool- ers between multistage compressors is to reduce the horse- power necessary to compress the gas. The more intercoolers and stages, the closer the horsepower require- ment approaches the isothermal value. 13.4.3.1.1 Volumetric Efficiency The volumetric effi- ciency represents the efficiency of a compressor cylinder to compress gas. It may be defined as the ratio of the volume of gas actually delivered to the piston displacement, corrected to suction temperature and pressure. The principal reasons that the cylinder will not deliver the piston displacement capacity are wire-drawing, a throttling effect on the valves; heating of the gas during admission to the cylinder; leakage past valves and piston rings; and re- expansion of the gas trapped in the clearance-volume space from the previous stroke. Re-expansion has by far the greatest effect on volumetric efficiency.The theoretical formula for volumetric efficiency is Ev¼1/C0(r1=k/C01)Cl, (13 :21) where Ev¼volumetric efficiency, fraction r¼cylinder compression ratio Cl¼clearance, fraction. In practice, adjustments are made to the theoretical formula in computing compressor performance: Ev¼0:97/C0zs zd/C18/C19 r1=k/C01/C20/C21 Cl/C0ev, (13 :22) where zs¼gas deviation factor at suction of the cylinder zd¼gas deviation factor at discharge of the cylinder ev¼correction factor. In this equation, the constant 0.97 is a reduction of 1 to correct for minor inefficiencies such as incomplete filling of the cylinder during the intake stroke. The correction factor evis to correct for the conditions in a particular application that affect the volumetric efficiency and for which the theoretical formula is inadequate. 13.4.3.1.2 Stage Compression The ratio of the dis- charge pressure to the inlet pressure is called the pressure ratio. The volumetric efficiencybecomes less, andmechanical stress limitation becomes more, pronounced as pressure ratio increases. Natural gas is usually compressed in stages, with the pressure ratio per stage being less than 6. In field practice, the pressure ratio seldom exceeds 4 when boosting gas from low pressure for processing or sale. When the total compression ratio is greater than this, more stages of compression are used to reach high pressures. The total power requirement is a minimum when the pressure ratio in each stage is the same. This may be expressed in equation form as r¼pd ps/C18/C191=Ns , (13 :23) where pd¼final discharge pressure, absolute ps¼suction pressure, absolute Ns¼number of stages required. As large compression ratios result in gas being heated to undesirably high temperatures, it is common practice to cool the gas between stages and, if possible, after the final stage of compression. 13.4.3.1.3 Isentropic Horsepower The computation is based on the assumption thatthe process is ideal isentropic or perfectly reversible adiabatic. The total ideal horsepower for a given compression is the sum of the ideal work computed for each stage of compression. The ideal isentropic work can be determined for each stage of compression in a number of ways.One wayto solvea compressionproblemisbyusing the Mollier diagram. This method is not used in this book because it is not easily computerized. Another approach commonly used is to calculate the horsepower for each stage from the isentropic work formula: w¼k k/C0153:241T1 ggp2 p1/C18/C19(k/C01)=k /C01\"# , (13 :24) where w¼theoretical shaft work required to compress the gas, ft-lb f=lbm T1¼suction temperature of the gas, 8RGAS LIFT 13/189gg¼gas-specific gravity, air ¼1 p1¼suction pressure of the gas, psia p2¼pressure of the gas at discharge point, psia. When the deviation from ideal gas behavior is appre- ciable, Eq. (13.24) is empirically modified. One such modi- fication is w¼k k/C0153:241T1 ggp2 p1/C18/C19Z1(k/C01)=k /C01\"# (13:25) or, in terms of power, HpMM¼k k/C013:027pb TbT1p2 p1/C18/C19Z1(k/C01)=k /C01\"# , (13 :26) where HpMM¼required theoretical compression power, hp/ MMcfd z1¼compressibility factor at suction conditions. The theoretical adiabatic horsepower obtained by the proceeding equations can be converted to brake horsepower (Hpb) required at the end of prime mover of the compressor using an overall efficiency factor, Eo. The brake horsepower is the horsepower input into the compressor. The efficiency factor Eoconsists of two components: compression efficiency (compressor-valve losses) and the mechanical efficiency of the compressor. The overall efficiency of a compressor depends on a number of factors, including design details of the compressor, suction pressure, speed of the compressor, compression ratio, loading, and general mechanical condition of the unit. In most modern compres- sors, the compression efficiency ranges from 83 to 93%. The mechanical efficiency of most modern compressors ranges from 88 to 95%. Thus, most modern compressors have an overall efficiency ranging from 75 to 85%, based on the ideal isentropic compression process as a standard. The actual efficiency curves can be obtained from the manufacturer. Applying these factors to the theoretical horsepower gives Hpb¼qMMHpMM Eo, (13 :27) where qMMis the gas flow rate in MMscfd. The discharge temperature for real gases can be calcu- lated by T2¼T1p2 p1/C18/C19z1(k/C01)=k : (13:28) Calculation of the heat removed by intercoolers and after- coolers can be accomplished using constant pressure- specific heat data: DH¼nGCpDT, (13 :29) where nG¼number of lb-mole of gas Cp¼specific heat under constant pressure evaluated at cooler operating pressure and the average tem- perature, btu/lb-mol- 8F.

The solution given by the program for the first stage of compression in this example problem is shown in Table 13.2. 13.4.3.2 Centrifugal Compressors Although the adiabatic compression process can be assumed in centrifugal compression, polytropic compression process is commonly considered as the basis for comparing centrifu- gal compressor performance. The process is expressed as13/190 ARTIFICIAL LIFT METHODSpVn¼constant, (13 :30) where ndenotes the polytropic exponent.

The polytro- pic efficiency chart presented by Rollins (1973) can be represented by the following correlation (Guo and Ghalambor, 2005): Ep¼0:61þ0:03 log ( q1), (13 :32) where q1¼gas capacity at the inlet condition, cfm. There is a lower limit of gas flow rate below which severe gas surge occurs in the compressor. This limit is called surge limit.

The solution given by the program to this example problem is shown in Table 13.3. 13.5 Selection of Gas Lift Valves Kickoff of a dead well requires a much higher gas pressure than the ultimate operating pressure. Because of the kickoff problem, gas lift valves have been developed and are run as part of the overall tubing string. These valves permit the introduction of gas (which is us ually injected down the annu- lus) into the fluid column in tu bing at intermediate depths to unload the well and initiate we ll flow. Proper design of these valve depths to unsure unloading requires a thorough under- standing of the unloading process and valve characteristics. 13.5.1 Unloading Sequence Figure 13.7 shows a well unloading process. Usually all valves are open at the initial condition, as depicted in Fig. 13.7a, due to high tubing pressures. The fluid in tubing has a pressure gradient Gsof static liquid column. When the gas enters the first (top) valve as shown in Fig. 13.7b, it creates a slug of liquid–gas mixture of less- density in the tubing above the valve depth. Expansion of the slug pushes the liquid column above it to flow to the surface. It can also cause the liquid in the bottom hole to flow back to reservoir if no check valve is installed at the end of the tubing string. However, as the length of the light slug grows due to gas injection, the bottom-hole pressure will eventually decrease to below reservoir pressure, which causes inflow of reservoir fluid. When the tubing pressure at the depth of the first valve is low enough, the first valve should begin to close and the gas should be forced to the second valve as shown in Fig. 13.7c. Gas injection to the second valve will gasify the liquid in the tubing between the first and the second valve. This will further reduce bottom-hole pressure and cause more inflow. By the time the slug reaches the depth of the first valve, the first valve should be closed, allowing more gas to be injected to the second valve. The same process should occur until the gas enters the main valve (Fig. 13.7d). The main valve (sometimes called the master valve oroperating valve ) is usually the lower most valve in the tubing string. It is an orifice type of valve that never closes. In continuous gas lift operations, once the well is fully unloaded and a steady-state flow is established, the main valve is the only valve open and in operation (Fig. 13.7e). 13.5.2 Valve Characteristics Equations (13.12) and (13.16) describing choke flow are also applicable to the main valve of orifice type. Flow characteristics of this type of valve are depicted in Fig. 13.8. Under sonic flow conditions, the gas passage is independent of tubing pressure but not casing pressure.13/192 ARTIFICIAL LIFT METHODSThere are different types of unloading valves, namely casing pressure-operated valve (usually called a pressure valve ), throt- tling pressure valve (also called a proportional valve orcontinu- ous flow valve ), fluid-operated valve (also called a fluid valve ), and combination valve (also called a fluid open-pressure closed valve). Different gas lift design methods have been developed and used in the oil industry for applications of these valves. 13.5.2.1 Pressure Valve Pressure valves are further classified as unbalanced bellow valves, balanced pressure valves, and pilot valves. Tubing pressure affects the opening action of the unbalanced valves, but it does not affect the opening or closing of balanced valves. Pilot valves were developed for intermit- tent gas lift with large ports. 13.5.2.1.1 Unbalanced Bellow Valve As shown in Fig. 13.9, an unbalanced be llow valve has a pressure- charged nitrogen dome and an optional spring loading element. While the forces from the dome pressure and spring act to cause closing of the valve, the forces due to casing and tubing pressures act to cause opening of the valve. Detailed discussions of valve mechanics can be found in Brown (1980). When a valve is at its closed condition (as shown in Fig. 13.9), the minimum casing pressure required to open the valve is called the valve opening pressure and is expressed asPvo¼1 1/C0RPdþSt/C0R 1/C0RPt, (13 :42) where Pvo¼valve opening pressure, psig Pd¼pressure in the dome, psig St¼equivalent pressure caused by spring tension, psig Pt¼tubing pressure at valve depth when the valve opens, psi R¼area ratio Ap=Ab Ap¼valve seat area, in :2 Ab¼total effective bellows area, in :2.

(13.42) is used for determining the required dome pressure at depth, that is, Pd¼(1/C0R)Pvo/C0StþRPt,i n valve selection. When a valve is at its open condition (as shown in Fig. 13.10), the maximum pre ssure under the ball (assumed to be casing pressure) required to close the valve is called thevalve closing pressure and is expressed as Pvc¼PdþSt1/C0RðÞ , (13 :43) where Pvc¼valve closing pressure, psig.

The spread controls the minimum amount of gas used for each cycle. As the spread increases, the amount of gas injected during the cycle increases. Gas passage of unbalanced valves are tubing-pressure dependent due to partial travel of the valve stem. Figure 13.11 illustrates flow characteristics of unbalanced valves. 13.5.2.1.2 Balanced Pressure Valve Figure 13.12 depicts a balanced pressure valve. Tubing pressure does not influence valve status when in the closed or open condition. The valve opens and closes at the same pressure—dome pressure. Balanced pressure valves act as expanding orifice regulators, opening to pass any amount of gas injected from the surface and partial closing to control the lower gas flow rate. 13.5.2.1.3 Pilot Valve Figure 13.13 shows a sketch of a pilot valve used for intermittent gas lift where a large portInitial condition(a) (b) (c) (d) (e)Gas enters the first valve Gas enters the second valveGs All valves openPtbg All valves openGs Gf GfThe first valve begins to closePtbg Ptbg Gas enters the last valve Unloaded conditionValves closed Valve begins to close All unloading valves closed GfGfPtbg Ptbg Figure 13.7 Well unloading sequence.

It has two ports. The smaller port (control port) is used for opening calculations and the large port (power port) is used for gas passage calculations. The equations derived from unbalanced valves are also valid for pilot valves. 13.5.2.2 Throttling Pressure Valve Throttling pressure valves are also called continuous flow valves . As shown in Fig. 13.14, the basic elementsof a throttling valve are the same as the pressure-operated valve except that the entrance port of the valve is choked to drop the casing pressure to tubing pressure by using a tapered stem or seat, which allows the port area to sense tubing pressure when the valve is open. Unlike pressure-operated valves where the casing pressure must drop to a pressure set by dome pressure and spring for the valve to close, a throttling pressure valve will close on a reduction in tubing pressure with the casing pressure held constant.

AbSt Pc ApPtPd Figure 13.10 Unbalanced bellow valve at its open condition.GAS LIFT 13/195valves are also to be applied to throttling valves for opening pressure calculations. 13.5.2.3 Fluid-Operated Valve As shown in Fig. 13.15, the basic elements of a fluid-oper- ated valve are identical to those in a pressure-operated valve except that tubing pressure now acts on the larger area of the bellows and casing pressure acts on the area of the port. This configuration makes the valve mostly sensitive to the tubing fluid pressure. Therefore, the opening pressure isdefined as the tubing pressure required to open the valve under actual operating conditions. Force balance gives Pvo¼1 1/C0RPdþSt/C0R 1/C0RPc, (13 :44) where Pc¼casing pressure, psig. The termR 1/C0RPcis called the C.E. andR 1/C0Ris called T.E.F. for fluid valves. With other parameters given, Eq. (13.44) is used for determining required dome pressure at depth, that is, Pd¼(1/C0R)Pvo/C0StþRPc, in valve selection. When a fluid valve is in its open position under operat- ing conditions, the maximum pressure under the ball (as- sumed to be tubing pressure) required to close the valve is called the valve closing pressure and is expressed as Pvc¼PdþSt1/C0RðÞ , (13 :45) which is identical to that for a pressure-operated valve. The first generation of fluid valves is a differential valve. As illustrated in Fig. 13.16, a differential valve relies on the difference between the casing pressure and the spring pressure effect to open and close. The opening and closing pressures are the same tubing pressure defined as Pvo¼Pvc¼Pc/C0St: (13:46) 13.5.2.4 Combination Valves Figure 13.17 shows that a combination valve consists of two portions. The upper portion is essentially the same as that found in pressure-operated valves, and the lower portion is a fluid pilot, or a differential pressure device incorporating a stem and a spring. Holes in the pilot housing allow the casing pressure to act on the area of the stem at the upper end. The spring acts to hold the stemqgGas Flow RatePtTubing Pressure Casing pressureThrottling range Maximum flow rate Figure 13.11 Flow characteristics of unbalanced valves.

This is the open position for the pilot. The casing pressure acts to move the stem to the closed position. The fluid pilot will only open when tubing pressure acting on the pilot area is sufficient to overcome the casing pressure force and move the stem up to the open position. At the instant of opening, the pilot opens completely, providing instantaneous operation for inter- mittent lift.13.5.3 Valve Spacing Various methods are being used in the industry for design- ing depths of valves of different types. They are the universal design method, the API-recommended method, the fallback method, and the percent load method. However, the basic objective should be the same: 1. To be able to open unloading valves with kickoff and injection operating pressures 2. To ensure single-point injection during unloading and normal operating conditions 3. To inject gas as deep as possible No matter which method is used, the following principles apply: .The design tubing pressure at valve depth is between gas injection pressure (loaded condition) and the minimum tubing pressure (fully unloaded condition). .Depth of the first valve is designed on the basis of kickoff pressure from a special compressor for well kickoff oper- ations. .Depths of other valves are designed on the basis of injection operating pressure. .Kickoff casing pressure margin, injection operating cas- ing pressure margin, and tubing transfer pressure mar- gin are used to consider the following effects: 8Pressure drop across the valve 8Tubing pressure effect of the upper valve 8Nonlinearity of the tubing flow gradient curve. The universal design method explained in this section is valid for all types of continuous-flow gas lift valves. Still, different procedures are used with the universal design method, including the following: a. Design procedure using constant surface opening pres- sure for pressure-operated valves. b. Design procedure using 10- to 20-psi drop in surface closing pressures between valves for pressure-operated valves.TubingChokeApAbPd Pt Tubing Entry PortGas Charged Dome Bellows PcValve Entry Ports Stem and SeatValve Entry Ports Figure 13.14 A sketch of a throttling pressure valve.

Only the design procedure using constant surface opening pressure for pressure-operated valves is illustrated in this section. Figure 13.18 illustrates a graphical solution procedure of valve spacing using constant surface opening pressure for pressure-operated valves. The arrows in the figure depict the sequence of line drawing. For a continuous-flow gas lift, the analytical solution procedure is outlined as follows: 1. Starting from a desired wellhead pressure phfat surface, compute a flowing tubing-pressure traverse under fully unloaded condition. This can be done using various two- phase flow correlations such as the modified Hagedorn– Brown correlation ( HagedornBrownCorrelation.xls ). 2.

SetDphf¼0 if tubing pressure margin is not required. 3. Starting from a desired injection operating pressure pc at surface, compute a injection operating pressure line. This can be done using Eq. (13.7) or Eq. (13.9). 4.

Pressures in this line, denoted by pcd, represent injection pressure after adjustment for casing pressure margin.

Example Problem 13.5 Only 1 MMscf/day of lift gas is available for the well described in the Example Problem 13.1. If 1,000 psia is available to kick off the well and then a steady injection pressure of 800 psia is maintained for gas lift operation against a wellhead pressure of 130 psia, design locations of unloading and operating valves. Assume a casing pressure margin of 50 psi. Solution The hydrostatic pressure of well fluid (26 8API oil) is (0.39 psi/ft) (5,200 ft), or 2,028 psig, which is greater than the given reservoir pressure of 2,000 psia. Therefore, the well does not flow naturally. The static liquid level depth is estimated to be 5,200 /C0(2,000 /C014:7)=(0:39)¼110 ft : Depth of the top valve is calculated with Eq.

The modified Hagedorn–Brown correlation gives tubing pressure of 591 psia at depth of 5,000 ft. The design tubing flowing gradient is Gfd¼[591/C0(130 þ200)] = (5,000) or 0.052 psi/ft.

Valve test- ing sets dome pressure Pdand/or string load St. Both of the processes are valve-type dependent. 13.5.4.1 Valve Sizing Gas lift valves are sized on the basis of required gas passage through the valve. All the equations presented in Section 13.4.2.3 for choke flow are applicable to valve port area calculations. Unloading and operating valves (ori- fices) are sized on the basis of subcritical (subsonic flow) that occurs when the pressure ratio Pt=Pcis greater than the critical pressure ratio defined in the right-hand side of Eq. (13.11). The value of the kis about 1.28 for natural gas. Thus, the critical pressure ratio is about 0.55. Re- arranging Eq.

The pressure is called test rack opening pressure (Ptro). The test is run with zero tubing pressure for pres- sure-operated valves and zero casing pressure for fluid- operated valves at a standard temperature (60 8F in the U.S. petroleum industry). For pressure-operated unbal- anced bellow valves at zero tubing pressure, Eq. (13.42) becomes Ptro¼Pdat 60/C14F 1/C0RþSt: (13:57) For fluid-operated valves at zero casing pressure, Eq. (13.44) also reduces to Eq. (13.57) at zero casing pressure and 60 8F. To set Pdat 60 8F to a value representing Pdat valve depth condition, real gas law must be used for cor- rection: Pdat 60/C14F¼520z 60/C14FPd Tdzd, (13 :58) where Td¼temperature at valve depth, 8R zd¼gas compressibility factor at valve depth condition. Thezfactors in Eq. (13.58) can be determined using the Hall–Yarborogh correlation. Computer spreadsheet Hall- Yarborogh-z.xls is for this purpose.

The spreadsheet program GasLiftValveDesign.xls can be used to seek solutions of similar problems. 13.6 Special Issues in Intermittent-Flow Gas Lift The intermittent-flow mechanism is very different from that of the continuous-flow gas lift. It is normally applicable in either high-BHP–low PI or low-BHP–low PI reservoirs. In these two reservoir cases, an excessive high drawdown is needed, which results in a prohibitively high GLR to pro- duce the desired quantity of oil (liquid) by continuous gas lift. In many instances, the reservoir simply is not capable of giving up the desired liquid regardless of drawdown. The flow from a well using intermittent gas lift techniques is called ‘‘ballistic’’ or ‘‘slug’’ flow. Two major factors that define the intermittent-gas lift process must be understood: 1. Complex flowing gradient of the gas lifted liquids from the well. 2. Contribution of the PI of the well to the actual deliver- ability of liquid to the surface. Figure 13.19 shows the BHP of a well being produced by intermittent-flow gas lift. The BHP at the instant the valve opens is indicated by Point A. The pressure impulse results in an instantaneous pressure buildup at Point B, which reaches a maximum at Cafter the initial acceleration of the oil column. Figure 13.20 shows the intermittent-flowing gradient, which is a summation of the gradient of gas above the slug, the gradient of the slug, and the gradient of the lift gas and entrained liquids below the slug.

The number of cycles per day is approximately 24 60ðÞ 45¼32 cycles/day. The number of bbls per cycle is100 32/C253 bbls =cycle. Intermittent-gas lift operating experience shows that depending on depth, 30–60% of the total liquid slug is lost due to slippage or fallback. If a 40% loss of starting slug is assumed, the volume of the starting slug is3 0:60/C255:0 bbl =cycle. Because the capacity of our tubing is 0.00387 bbl/ft, the length of the starting slug is5:0 0:00387/C251,292 ft. This means that the operating valve should be located 1,292 2¼646 ft below the working fluid level. Therefore, the depth to the operating valve is 5,494 þ646¼6,140 ft. The pressure in the tubing opposite the operating valve with the 50 psig surface back-pressure (neglecting the weight of the gas column) is pt¼50þ1,292ðÞ 0:379ðÞ ¼ 540 psig : For minimum slippage and fallback, a minimum velocity of the slug up the tubing should be 100 ft/min. This is accomplished by having the pressure in the casing opposite the operating valve at the instant the valve opens to be at least 50% greater than the tubing pressure with a minimum differential of 200 psi. Therefore, for a tubing pressure at the valve depth of 540 psig, at the instant the valve opens, the minimum casing pressure at 6,140 ft is pminc¼540þ540=2¼810 psig : Equation (13.10) gives a pso¼707 psig. The minimum volume of gas required to lift the slug to the surface will be that required to fill the tubing frominjection depth to surface, less the volume occupied by the slug. Thus, this volume is 6,140 þ1,292 ðÞ 0:00387 ¼ 18:8 bbls, which converts to 105 :5f t3. The approximate pressure in the tubing immediately under a liquid slug at the instant the slug surfaces is equal to the pressure due to the slug length plus the tubing backpressure. This is pts¼50þ3:0 0:00387/C20/C21 0:379ðÞ ¼ 344 psig : Thus, the average pressure in the tubing is ptave¼810þ344 2¼577 psig ¼591:7 psia : The average temperature in the tubing is 127 8F or 587 8R.

They fall into four categories: (1) open installation, (2) semiclosed installation, (3) closed installation, and (4) chamber installation. As shown in Fig. 13.22a, no packer is set in open installa- tions. This type of installation is suitable for continuous flow gas lift in wells with good fluid seal. Although this type of installation is simple, it expos es all gas lift valves beneath the point of gas injection to severe fluid erosion due to the dynamic changing of liquid level in the annulus. Open installation is not recommended unless setting packer is not an option.

It is identical to the open installation except that a packer is set between the tubing and casing. This type of installation can be used for both continuous- and intermittent-flow gas lift operations. It avoids all the problems associated with the open installations. However, it still does not prevent flow of well fluids back to formation during unloading processes, which is especially important for intermittent operating. Illustrated in Fig. 13.22c is a closed installation where a standing valve is placed in the tubing string or below the bottom gas lift valve. The standing valve effectively pre- vents the gas pressure from acting on the formation, whichincreases the daily production rate from a well of the intermittent type. Chamber installations are used for accumulating liquid volume at bottom hole of intermittent-flow gas lift wells. A chamber is an ideal installation for a low BHP and high PI well. The chambers can be configured in various ways including using two packers, insert chamber, and reverse flow chamber. Figure 13.23 shows a standard two-packer chamber. This type of chamber is installed to ensure a large storage volume of liquids with a minimum amount of backpressure on the formation so that the liquid pro- duction rate is not hindered. aProduction Out Gas In OpenProduction Out Gas In Semi-ClosedProduction Out Gas In Closed c bContinuous Flow Applications Intermitting Lift Applications  Figure 13.22 Three types of gas lift installations. aFlow Unloading Gas lift Valves Bottom unloading Gas lift Valves Operating Chamber Gas lift Valves By-pass Packer Perforated sub Bottom PackerStanding ValveGas Bleed Valve Standing Valve bStanding Valve modified for handing Sand  Figure 13.23 Sketch of a standard two-packer chamber.13/204 ARTIFICIAL LIFT METHODSFigure 13.24 illustrates an insert chamber. It is normally used in a long open hole or perforated interval where squeezing of fluids back to formation by gas pressure is a concern. It takes the advantage of existing bottom-hole pressure. The disadvantage of the installation is that the chamber size is limited by casing diameter. Shown in Fig. 13.25 is a reverse flow chamber. It ensures venting of all formation gas into the tubing string to empty the chamber for liquid accumulation. For wells with high- formation GLR, this option appears to be an excellent choice. Summary This chapter presents the principles of gas lift systems and illustrates a procedure for designing gas lift operations. Major tasks include calculations of well deliverability, pressure and horsepower requirements for gas lift gas compression, gas lift valve selection and spacing, andselection of installation methods.

They are electrical submersible pumping, hydraulic piston pumping, hydraulic jet pumping, progressive cavity pumping, and plunger lift systems. All these systems are continuous pumping systems except the plunger lift, which is very similar to intermittent gas lift systems. 14.2 Electrical Submersible Pump Electrical submersible pumps (ESPs) are easy to install and operate. They can lift extremely high volumes from highly productive oil reservoirs. Crooked/deviated holes present no problem. ESPs are applicable to offshore operations. Lifting costs for high volumes are generally very low. Limitations to ESP applications include high- voltage electricity availability, not applicable to multiple completions, not suitable to deep and high-temperature oil reservoirs, gas and solids production is troublesome, and costly to install and repair. ESP systems have higher horsepower, operate in hotter applications, are used in dual installations and as spare down-hole units, and include down-hole oil/water separation. Sand and gas problems have led to new products. Automation of the systems includes monitoring, analysis, and control. The ESP is a relatively efficient artificial lift. Under certain conditions, it is even more efficient than sucker rod beam pumping. As shown in Fig. 14.1, an ESP consists of subsurface and surface components.a. Subsurface components - Pump - Motor - Seal electric cable - Gas separator b. Surface components - Motor controller (or variable speed controller) - Transformer - Surface electric cable The overall ESP system operates like any electric pump commonly used in other industrial applications. In ESP operations, electric energy is transported to the down-hole electric motor via the electric cables. These electric cables are run on the side of (and are attached to) the production tubing. The electric cable provides the electrical energy needed to actuate the down-hole electric motor. The elec- tric motor drives the pump and the pump imparts energy to the fluid in the form of hydraulic power, which lifts the fluid to the surface. 14.2.1 Principle ESPs are pumps made of dynamic pump stages or centri- fugal pump stages. Figure 14.2 gives the internal schematic of a single-stage centrifugal pump. Figure 14.3 shows a cutaway of a multistage centrifugal pump. The electric motor connects directly to the centrifugal pump module in an ESP. This means that the electric motor shaft connects directly to the pump shaft. Thus, the pump rotates at the same speed as the electric motor.

The number of stages to be used in a particular outside diam- eter sized pump is determined by the volumetric flow rate and the lift (height) required. Thus, the length of a pump module can be 40–344 in. in length. Electric motors are three-phase (AC), squirrel cage, induction type. They can vary from 10 to 750 hp at 60 Hz or 50 Hz (and range from 33⁄4to 71⁄4in. in diameter). Their voltage requirements vary from 420–4,200 V. The seal system (the protector) separates the well fluids from the electric motor lubrication fluids and the electrical wiring. The electric controller (surface) serves to energizethe ESP, sensing such conditions as overload, well pump- off, short in cable, and so on. It also shuts down or starts up in response to down-hole pressure switches, tank levels, or remote commands. These controllers are available in conventional electromechanical or solid-state devices. Conventional electromechanical controllers give a fixed- speed, fixed flow rate pumping. To overcome this limita- tion, the variable speed controller has been developed (solid state). These controllers allow the frequency of the electric current to vary. This results in a variation in speed (rpm) and, thus, flow rate. Such a device allows changes to be made (on the fly) whenever a well changes volume (static level), pressure, GLR, or WOR. It also allows flexi- bility for operations in wells where the PI is not well known. The transformer (at surface) changes the voltage of the distribution system to a voltage required by the ESP system. Unlike positive-displacement pumps, centrifugal pumps do not displace a fixed amount of fluid but create a rela- tively constant amount of pressure increase to the flow system. The output flow rate depends on backpressure. The pressure increase is usually expressed as pumping head, the equivalent height of freshwater that the pressure differential can support (pumps are tested with freshwater by the manufacturer). In U.S. field units, the pumping head is expressed as h¼Dp 0:433, (14:1) where h¼pumping head, ft Dp¼pump pressure differential, psi. As the volumetric throughput increases, the pumping head of a centrifugal pump decreases and power slightly increases. However, there exists an optimal range of flow rate where the pump efficiency is maximal. A typical ESP characteristic chart is shown in Fig. 14.4. ESPs can operate over a wide range of parameters (depths and volumes), to depths over 12,000 ft and volu- metric flow rates of up to 45,000 bbl/day. Certain operat- ing variables can severely limit ESP applications, including the following: .Free gas in oil .Temperature at depth .Viscosity of oil .Sand content fluid .Paraffin content of fluid Excessive free gas results in pump cavitation that leads to motor fluctuations that ultimately reduces run life and reliability. High temperature at depth will limit the life of the thrust bearing, the epoxy encapsula- tions (of electronics, etc.), insulation, and elastomers. Increased viscosity of the fluid to be pumped reduces the total head that the pump system can generate, which leads to an increased number of pump stages and increased horsepower requirements. Sand and paraffin content in the fluid will lead to wear and choking conditions inside the pump. 14.2.2 ESP Applications The following factors are important in designing ESP applications: .PI of the well .Casing and tubing sizes .Static liquid level ESPs are usually for high PI wells. More and more ESP applications are found in offshore wells. The outside di- ameter of the ESP down-hole equipment is determined by the inside diameter (ID) of the borehole. There must be Diffuser Impeller Figure 14.2 An internal schematic of centrifugal pump. Figure 14.3 A sketch of a multistage centrifugal pump.OTHER ARTIFICIAL LIFT METHODS 14/209clearance around the outside of the pump down-hole equipment to allow the free flow of oil/water to the pump intake. The desired flow rate and tubing size will determine the total dynamic head (TDH) requirements for the ESP system. The ‘‘TDH’’ is defined as the pressure head immediately above the pump (in the tubing). This is converted to feet of head (or meters of head). This TDH is usually given in water equivalent. Thus, TDH ¼static column of fluid (net) head + friction loss head + back- pressure head. The following procedure can be used for selecting an ESP: 1. Starting from well inflow performance relationship (IPR), determine a desirable liquid production rate qLd. Then select a pump size from the manufacturer’s specification that has a minimum delivering flow rate qLp, that is, qLp>qLd. 2. From the IPR, determine the flowing bottom-hole pressure pwfat the pump-delivering flow rate qLp, not theqLd. 3.

This can be carried out quickly using the computer spreadsheet HagedornBrownCorrelation.xls . 5. Calculate the required pump pressure differential Dp¼pdisch arge/C0psuction and then required pumping head by Eq. (14.1). 6. From the manufacturer’s pump characteristics curve, read pump head or head per stage. Then calculate the required number of stages.7. Determine the total power required for the pump by multiplying the power per stage by the number of stages. Example Problem 14.1 A 10,000-ft-deep well produces 328API oil with GOR 50 scf/stb and zero water cut through a 3-in. (2.992-in. ID) tubing in a 7-in. casing. The oil has a formation volume factor of 1.25 and average viscosity of 5 cp. Gas-specific gravity is 0.7. The surface and bottom-hole temperatures are 70 8F and 1708F, respectively. The IPR of the well can be described by the Vogel model with a reservoir pressure 4,350 psia and AOF 15,000 stb/day. If the well is to be put in production with an ESP to produce liquid at 8,000 stb/day against a flowing wellhead pressure of 100 psia, determine the required specifications for an ESP for this application. Assume the minimum pump suction pressure is 200 psia. Solution 1.

The required power for a 38-stage pump is then (6)(38) ¼226 hp. The solution given by the computer spreadsheet ESP- design.xls is shown in Table 14.1. 14.3 Hydraulic Piston Pumping Hydraulic piston pumping systems can lift large volumes of liquid from great depth by pumping wells down to fairly low pressures. Crooked holes present minimal problems. Both natural gas and electricity can be used as the power source. They are also applicable to multiple completions and offshore operations. Their major disadvantages in- clude power oil systems being fire hazards and costly, power water treatment problems, and high solids produc- tion being troublesome.As shown in Fig. 14.5, a hydraulic piston pump (HPP) consists of an engine with a reciprocating piston driven by a power fluid connected by a short shaft to a piston in the pump end. HPPs are usually double-acting, that is, fluid is being displaced from the pump on both the upstroke and the downstroke. The power fluid is injected down a tubing string from the surface and is either returned to the surface through another tubing (closed power fluid) or commin- gled with the produced fluid in the production string (open power fluid). Because the pump and engine pistons are directly connected, the volumetric flow rates in the pump and engine are related through a simple equation (Cholet, 2000): qpump¼qengApump Aeng, (14 :3) where qpump= flow rate of the produced fluid in the pump, bbl/day qeng¼flow rate of the power fluid, bbl/day Apump¼net cross-sectional area of pump piston, in :2 Aeng¼net cross-sectional area of engine piston, in :2. Equation (14.3) implies that liquid production rate is proportional to the power fluid injection rate. The propor- tionality factor Apump=Aengis called the ‘‘P/E ratio.’’ By adjusting the power fluid injection rate, the liquid produc- tion rate can be proportionally changed. Although the P/E ratio magnifies production rate, a larger P/E ratio means higher injection pressure of the power fluid. The following pressure relation can be derived from force balance in the HPP: peng,i/C0peng,d¼ppump,d/C0ppump,iÞP=EðÞ þ Fpump,/C0 (14:4) where peng,i¼pressure at engine inlet, psia peng,d¼engine discharge pressure, psia ppump,d¼pump discharge pressure, psia Table 14.1 Result Given by the Computer Spreadsheet ESPdesign.xls ESPdesign.xls Description: This spreadsheet calculates parameters for ESP selection.

With its abil- ity to move large volumes of water, the progressing cavity pump is also used for coal bed methane, dewatering, and water source wells. The PCP reduces overall operating costs by increasing operating efficiency while reducing energy requirements. The major disadvantages of PCPs include short operating life (2–5 years) and high cost. 14.4.1 Down-Hole PCP Characteristics Proper selection of a PCP requires knowledge of PCP geometry, displacement, head, and torque requirements.

They are very inexpensive installations. Plunger automatically keeps tubing clean of paraffin and scale. But they are good for low-rate wells normally less than 200 B/D. Listiak (2006) presents a thorough discussion of this technology.ESectionD D+2E D+4EPr PsStator Centerline Rotor Centerline Pump Assembly Rotor Stator Figure 14.7 Rotor and stator geometry of PCP.OTHER ARTIFICIAL LIFT METHODS 14/215Traditionally, plunger lift was used on oil wells. Recently, plunger lift has become more common on gas wells for de-watering purposes. As shown in Fig. 14.8, high-pressure gas wells produce gas carrying liquid water and/or condensate in the form of mist. As the gas flow velocity in the well drops as a result of the reservoir pressure depletion, the carrying capacity of the gas de- creases. When the gas velocity drops to a critical level, liquid begins to accumulate in the well and the well flow can undergo annular flow regime followed by a slug flow regime. The accumulation of liquids (liquid loading) in- creases bottom-hole pressure that reduces gas production rate. Low gas production rate will cause gas velocity to drop further. Eventually the well will undergo bubbly flow regime and cease producing. Liquid loading is not always obvious, and recognizing the liquid-loading problem is not an easy task. A thorough diagnostic analysis of well data needs to be performed. The symptoms to look for include onset of liquid slugs at the surface of well, increasing difference between the tubing and casing pressures with time, sharp changes in gradient on a flowing pressure survey, sharp drops in a production decline curve, and prediction with analytical methods. Accurate prediction of the problem is vital for taking timely measures to solve the problem. Previous investiga- tors have suggested several methods to predict the prob- lem. Results from these methods often show discrepancies. Also, some of these methods are not easy to use because of the difficulties with prediction of bottom-hole pressure in multiphase flow. Turner et al. (1969) were the pioneer investigators who analyzed and predicted the minimum gas flow rate capable of removing liquids from the gas production wells. They presented two mathematical models to describe the liquid- loading problem: the film movement model and entrained drop movement model. On the basis of analyses on field data they had, they concluded that the film movement model does not represent the controlling liquid transport mechanism. The Turner et al. entrained drop movement model was derived on the basis of the terminal-free settling velocity of liquid drops and the maximum drop diameter correspond- ing to the critical Weber number of 30. According to Turner et al. (1969), gas will continuously remove liquids from the well until its velocity drops to below the terminal velocity. The minimum gas flow rate for a particular set of conditions (pressure and conduit geometry) can be calcu- lated using a mathematical model. Turner et al. (1969)found that this entrained drop movement model gives underestimates of the minimum gas flow rates. They recommended the equation-derived values be adjusted upward by approximately 20% to ensure removal of all drops. Turner et al. (1969) believed that the discrepancy was attributed to several facts including the use of drag coefficients for solid spheres, the assumption of stagnation velocity, and the critical Weber number established for drops falling in air, not in compressed gas. The main problem that hinders the application of the Turner et al. entrained drop model to gas wells comes from the difficulties of estimating the values of gas density and pressure. Using an average value of gas-specific gravity (0.6) and gas temperature (120 8F), Turner et al. derived an expression for gas density as 0.0031 times the pressure. However, they did not present a method for calculating the gas pressure in a multiphase flow wellbore. Starting from the Turner et al. entrained drop model, Guo and Ghalambor (2005) determined the minimum kinetic energy of gas that is required to lift liquids. A four-phase (gas, oil, water, and solid particles) mist- flow model was developed. Applying the minimum kinetic energy criterion to the four-phase flow model resulted in a closed-form analytical equation for predicting the min- imum gas flow rate. Through case studies, Guo and Gha- lambor demonstrated that this new method is more conservative and accurate. Their analysis also indicates that the controlling conditions are bottom-hole conditions where gas has higher pressure and lower kinetic energy. This analysis is consistent with the observations from air- drilling operations where solid particles accumulate at bottom-hole rather than top-hole (Guo and Ghalambor, 2002). However, this analysis contradicts the results by Turner et al. (1969), that indicated that the wellhead con- ditions are, in most instances, controlling. 14.5.1 Working Principle Figure 14.9 illustrates a plunger lift system. Plunger lift uses a free piston that travels up and down in the well’s tubing string. It minimizes liquid fallback and uses the well’s energy more efficiently than in slug or bubble flow. The purpose of plunger lift is like that of other artificial lift methods: to remove liquids from the wellbore so that the well can be produced at the lowest bottom-hole pres- sures. Whether in a gas well, oil well, or gas lift well, the mechanics of a plunger lift system are the same. The plunger, a length of steel, is dropped down the tubing to the bottom of the well and allowed to travel back to the surface. It provides a piston-like interface between liquids and gas in the wellbore and prevents liquid fallback. By providing a ‘‘seal’’ between the liquid and gas, a well’s own energy can be used to efficiently lift liquids out of the wellbore. A plunger changes the rules for liquid removal. However, in a well without a plunger, gas velocity must be high to remove liquids. With a plunger, gas velocity can be very low. Unloading relies much more on the well’s ability to store enough gas pressure to lift the plunger and a liquid slug to surface, and less on critical flow rates. Plunger operation consists of shut-in and flow periods. The flow period is further divided into an unloading period and flow after plunger arrival. Lengths of these periods will vary depending on the application, producing capability of the well, and pressures. A plunger cycle starts with the shut-in period that allows the plunger to drop from the surface to the bottom of the well. At the same time, the well builds gas pressure stored either in the casing, in the fracture, or in the near wellbore region of the reservoir. The well must be shut in long enough to build reservoir pressure that will provide energy to lift both the plunger and the liquid slug to the surface against line pressure and friction. When this time andGas Flow Decreasing Gas VelocityMist FlowSlug FlowAnnular FlowBubble Flow Figure 14.8 Four flow regimes commonly encoun- tered in gas wells.14/216 ARTIFICIAL LIFT METHODSpressure have been reached, the flow period is started and unloading begins. In the initial stages of the flow period, the plunger and liquid slug begin traveling to the surface. Gas above the plunger quickly flows from the tubing into the flowline, and the plunger and liquid slug follow up the hole. The plunger arrives at the surface, unloading the liquid. Initially, high rates prevail (often three to four times the average daily rate) while the stored pressure is blown down. The well can now produce free of liquids, while the plunger remains at the surface, held by the well’s pressure and flow. As rates drop, velocities eventuallydrop below the critical rate, and liquids begin to accumu- late in the tubing. The well is shut in and the plunger falls back to the bottom to repeat the cycle. At the end of the shut-in period, the well has built pressure. The casing pressure is at its maximum, and the tubing pressure is lower than the casing pressure. The difference is equivalent to the hydrostatic pressure of the liquid in the tubing. When the well is opened, the tubing pressure quickly drops down to line pressure, while the casing pressure slowly decreases until the plunger reaches the surface.

This continues until the plun- ger reaches the surface. After the plunger surfaces, a large increase in flow rate will produce higher tubing pressures and an increase in flowline pressure. Tubing pressure will then drop very close to line pressure. Casing pressure will reach its minimum either on plunger arrival or after, as the casing blows down and the well produces with minimal liquids in the tubing. If the well stays above the critical unloading rate, the casing pressure will remain fairly con- stant or may decrease further. As the gas rate drops, liquids become held up in the tubing and casing pressure will increase. Upon shut in, the casing pressure builds more rapidly. How fast depends on the inflow performance and reservoir pressure of the well. The tubing pressure will increase quickly from line pressure, as the flowing gas friction ceases. It will eventually track casing pressure (less the liquid slug). Casing pressure will continue to increase to maximum pressure until the well is opened again. As with most wells, maximum plunger lift production occurs when the well produces against the lowest possible bottom-hole pressure. On plunger lift, the lowest average bottom-hole pressures are almost always obtained by shut- ting the well in the minimum amount of time. Practical experience and plunger lift models demonstrate that lifting large liquid slugs requires higher average bottom-hole pressure. Lengthy shut-in periods also increase average bottom-hole pressure. So the goal of plunger lift should be to shut the well in the minimum amount of time and produce only enough liquids that can be lifted at this minimum buildup pressure. What is the minimum shut-in time? The absolute min- imum amount of time for shut-in is the time it takes the plunger to reach the bottom. The well must be shut-in in this length of time regardless of what other operating conditions exist. Plungers typically fall between 200 and 1,000 ft/min in dry gas and 20 and 250 ft/min in liquids. Total fall time varies and is affected by plunger type, amount of liquids in the tubing, the condition of the tubing (crimped, corkscrewed, corroded, etc.), and the deviation of the tubing or wellbore. The flow period during and after plunger arrival is used to control liquid loads. In general, a short flow period brings in a small liquid load, and a long flow period brings in a larger liquid load. By controlling this flow time, the liquid load is controlled. So the well can be flowed until the desired liquid load has entered the tubing. A well with a high GLR may be capable of long flow periods without requiring more than minimum shut-in times. In this case, the plunger could operate as few as 1 or 2 cycles/ day. Conversely, a well with a low GLR may never be able to flow after plunger arrival and may require 25 cycles/day or more. In practice, if the well is shutting in for only the minimum amount of time, it can be flowed as long as possible to maintain target plunger rise velocities. If the well is shutting in longer than the minimum shut-in time, there should be little or no flow after the plunger arrives at the surface. 14.5.2 Design Guideline Plunger lift systems can be evaluated using rules of thumb in conjunction with historic well production or with a mathematical plunger model. Because plunger lift installa- tions are typically inexpensive, easy to install, and easy to test, most evaluations are performed by rules of thumb. 14.5.2.1 Estimate of Production Rates with Plunger Lift The simplest and sometimes most accurate method of determining production increases from plunger lift isfrom decline curve analysis. Gas and oil reservoirs typically have predictable declines, either exponential, harmonic, or hyperbolic. Initial production rates are usually high enough to produce the well above critical rates (unloaded) and establish a decline curve. When liquid loading occurs, a marked decrease and deviation from normal decline can be seen. By unloading the well with plunger lift, a normal decline can be reestablished. Production increases from plunger lift will be somewhere between the rates of the well when it started loading and the rate of an extended decline curve to the present time. Ideally, decline curves would be used in concert with critical velocity curves to predetermine when plunger lift should be installed. In this manner, plunger lift will maintain production on a steady decline and never allow the well to begin loading. Another method to estimate production is to build an inflow performance curve based on the backpressure equa- tion. This is especially helpful if the well has an open annu- lus and casing pressure is known. The casing pressure gives a good approximation of bottom-hole pressure. The IPR curve can be built based on the estimated reservoir pressure, casing pressure, and current flow rate. Because the job of plunger lift is to lower the bottom-hole pressure by remov- ing liquids, the bottom-hole pressure can be estimated with no liquids. This new pressure can be used to estimate a production rate with lower bottom-hole pressures. 14.5.2.2 GLR and Buildup Pressure Requirements There are two minimum requirements for plunger lift operation: minimum GLR and buildup pressure. For the plunger lift to operate, there must be available gas to provide the lifting force, in sufficient quantity per barrel of liquid for a given well depth. 14.5.2.2.1 Rules of Thumb As a rule of thumb, the minimum GLR requirement is considered to be about 400 scf/bbl/1,000 ft of well depth, that is, GLR min¼400D 1,000, (14 :23) where GLR min¼minimum required GLR for plunger lift, scf/bbl D¼depth to plunger, ft. Equation (14.23) is based on the energy stored in a com- pressed volume of 400 scf of gas expanding under the hydrostatic head of a barrel of liquid. The drawback is that no consideration is given to line pressures. Excessively high line pressures, relative to buildup pressure may in- crease the requirement. The rule of thumb also assumes that the gas expansion can be applied from a large open annulus without restriction. Slim-hole wells and wells with packers that require gas to travel through the reservoir or through small perforations in the tubing will cause a greater restriction and energy loss. This increases the minimum requirements to as much as 800–1,200 scf/bbl/1,000 ft. Well buildup pressure is the second requirement for plunger operation. This buildup pressure is the bot- tom-hole pressure just before the plunger begins its ascent (equivalent to surface casing pressure in a well with an open annulus). In practice, the minimum shut-in pres- sure requirement for plunger lift is equivalent to 1½ times maximum sales line pressure. The actual requirement may be higher. The rule works well in intermediate-depth wells (2,000–8,000 ft) with slug sizes of 0.1–0.5 barrels/cycle. It breaks down for higher liquid volumes, deeper wells (due to increasing friction), and excessive pressure restrictions at the surface or in the wellbore. An improved rule for minimum pressure is that a well can lift a slug of liquid equal to about 50–60% of the difference between shut-in casing pressure and maximum sales line pressure. This rule gives14/218 ARTIFICIAL LIFT METHODSpc¼pLmaxþpsh fsl, (14 :24) where pc¼required casing pressure, psia pLmax¼maximum line pressure, psia psh¼slug hydrostatic pressure, psia fsl¼slug factor, 0.5–0.6. This rule takes liquid production into account and can be used for wells with higher liquid production that require more than 1–2 barrels/cycle. It is considered as a conser- vative estimate of minimum pressure requirements. To use Eq. (14.24), first the total liquid production on plunger lift and number of cycles possible per day should be estimated. Then the amount of liquid that can be lifted per cycle should be determined. That volume of liquid per cycle is converted into the slug hydrostatic pressure using the well tubing size. Finally, the equation is used to estimate required casing pressure to operate the system. It should be noted that a well that does not meet minimum GLR and pressure requirements could still be plunger lifted with the addition of an external gas source. Design at this point becomes more a matter of the econo- mics of providing the added gas to the well at desired pressures. 14.5.2.2.2 Analytical Method Analytical plunger lift design methods have been developed on the basis of force balance. Several studies in the literature address the addition of makeup gas to a plunger installation through either exist- ing gas lift operations, the installation of a field gas supply system, or the use of wellhead compression. Some of the studies were presented by Beeson et al. (1955), Lebeaux and Sudduth (1955), Foss and Gaul (1965), Abercrombie (1980), Rosina (1983), Mower et al. (1985), and Lea (1981, 1999). The forces acting on the plunger at any given point in the tubing include the following: 1. Stored casing pressure acting on the cross-section of the plunger 2. Stored reservoir pressure acting on the cross-section of the plunger 3. Weight of the fluid 4. Weight of the plunger 5. Friction of the fluid with the tubing 6. Friction of the plunger with the tubing 7. Gas friction in the tubing 8. Gas slippage upward past the plunger 9. Liquid slippage downward past the plunger 10. Surface pressure (line pressure and restrictions) acting against the plunger travel Several publications have been written dealing with this approach. Beeson et al. (1955) first presented equations for high GLR wells based on an empirically derived analysis. Foss and Gaul (1965) derived a force balance equation for use on oil wells in the Ventura Avenue field. Mower et al. (1985) presented a dynamic analysis of plunger lift that added gas slippage and reservoir inflow and mathemati- cally described the entire cycle (not just plunger ascent) for tight-gas/very high GLR wells. The methodology used by Foss and Gaul (1965) was to calculate a casing pressure required to move the plunger and liquid slug just before it reached the surface, called Pcmin. Since Pc minis at the end of the plunger cycle, the energy of the expanding gas from the casing to the tubing is at its minimum. Adjusting Pc minfor gas expansion from the casing to the tubing during the full plunger cycle results in the pressure required to start the plunger at the begin- ning of the plunger cycle, or Pc max. The equations below are essentially the same equations presented by Foss and Gaul (1956) but are summarized here as presented by Mower et al. (1985). The Foss andGaul model is not rigorous, because it assumes constant friction associated with plunger rise velocities of 1,000 ft/ min, does not calculate reservoir inflow, assumes a value for gas slippage past the plunger, assumes an open unre- stricted annulus, and assumes the user can determine unloaded gas and liquid rates independently of the model. Also, this model was originally designed for oil well operation that assumed the well would be shut-in on plunger arrival, so the average casing pressure, Pc avg,i s only an average during plunger travel. The net result of these assumptions is an overprediction of required casing pressure. If a well meets the Foss and Gaul (1956) criteria, it is almost certainly a candidate for plunger lift. 14.5.2.3 Plunger Lift Models 14.5.2.3.1 Basic Foss and Gaul Equations (modified by Mower et al) The required minimum casing pressure is expressed as Pcmin¼Ppþ14:7þPtþPlhþPlf/C0/C1 /C2Vslug/C2/C3 /C21þD K/C18/C19 , (14 :25) where Pcmin¼required minimum casing pressure, psia Pp¼Wp=At, psia Wp¼plunger weight, lb f At¼tubing inner cross-sectional area, in :2 Plh¼hydrostatic liquid gradient, psi/bbl slug Plf¼flowing liquid gradient, psi/bbl slug Pt¼tubing head pressure, psia Vslug¼slug volume, bbl D¼depth to plunger, ft K¼characteristic length for gas flow in tubing, ft.

The simple rule of thumb gives pc¼1:5pLmax¼(1:5)(100) ¼150 psi : To calculate the minimum required casing pressure with the improved rule of thumb, the slug hydrostatic pressure needs to be known. For this case, assuming 10 cycles/day, equivalent to a plunger trip every 2.4 hours, and 10 bbls of liquid, the plunger will lift 1 bbl/cycle.

Thenpc¼pLmaxþpsh fsl¼100þ120 0:5t o0 :6¼300 to 340 psi : Since the well has 800 psi of available casing pressure, it meets the pressure requirements for plunger lift. The Foss and Gaul–type method can be used to deter- mine plunger lift operating range. Basic parameters are given in Table 14.3. Since the Foss and Gaul–type calculations involve de- termination of Z-factor values in Eq. (14.28) at different pressures, a spreadsheet program PlungerLift.xls was developed to speed up the calculation procedure. The solution is given in Table 14.4. It was given that the estimated production when unloaded is 200 Mcfd with 10 bbl/day of liquid (GLR ¼200=10¼20 Mscf =bbl), and the maximum casing pressure buildup is 800 psi. From the Table 14.4, find casing pressure of about 800 psi, GLR of 20 Mscf/bbl, and production rates of 10 bbl/day. This occurs at slug sizes between about 0.25 and 3 bbl. The well will operate on plunger lift. 14.6 Hydraulic Jet Pumping Figure 14.10 shows a hydraulic jet pump installation. The pump converts the energy from the injected power fluid (water or oil) to pressure that lifts production fluids. Because there is no moving parts involved, dirty and gassy fluids present no problem to the pump. The jet pumps can be set at any depth as long as the suction pressure is sufficient to prevent pump cavitation problem. The disadvantage of hydraulic jet pumps is their low efficiency (20–30%). 14.6.1 Working Principle Figure 14.11 illustrates the working principle of a hydraulic jet pump. It is a dynamic-displacement pump that differs from a hydraulic piston pump in the manner in which it increases the pressure of the pumped fluid with a jet nozzle. The power fluid enters the top of the pump from an injection tubing. The power fluid is then accelerated through the nozzle and mixed with the produced fluid in the throat of the pump. As the fluids mix, the momentum of the power fluid is partially transferred to the produced fluid and increases its kinetic energy (velocity head).

Performance enhancement ideas are from careful examinations and thorough analyses of production data to find the controlling factors affecting the performance. Part IV of this book presents procedures taken in the petroleum industry for identifying well problems and means of solving the problems. Materials are presented in the following four chapters.

For oil wells, these problems include .Low productivity .Excessive gas production .Excessive water production .Sand production For gas wells, the problems include .Low productivity .Excessive water production .Liquid loading .Sand production Although sand production is easy to identify, well testing and production logging are frequently needed to identify the causes of other well problems. 15.2 Low Productivity The lower than expected productivity of oil or gas well is found on the basis of comparison of the well’s actual production rate and the production rate that is predicted by Nodal analysis. If the reservoir inflow model used in the Nodal analysis is correct (which is often questionable), the lower than expected well productivity can be attributed to one or more of the following reasons: .Overestimate of reservoir pressure .Overestimate of reservoir permeability (absolute and relative permeabilities) .Formation damage (mechanical and pseudo skins).Reservoir heterogeneity (faults, stratification, etc.) .Completion ineffectiveness (limited entry, shallow per- forations, low perforation density, etc.) .Restrictions in wellbore (paraffin, asphaltane, scale, gas hydrates, sand, etc.) The first five factors affect reservoir inflow performance, that is, deliverability of reservoir. They can be evaluated on the basis of pressure transient data analyses. The true production profile from different zones can be obtained based on production logging such as temperature and spinner flow meter logs. An example is presented in Fig. 15.1, which shows that Zone A is producing less than 10% of the total flow, Zone B is producing almost 70% of the total rate, and Zone C is contributing about 25% of the total production. The last factor controls well deliverability. It can be evaluated using data from production logging such as flowing gradient survey (FGS). The depth interval with high-pressure gradient is usually the interval where the depositions of paraffins, asphaltanes, scales, or gas hydrates are suspected. 15.2.1 Pressure Transient Data Analysis Pressure transient testing plays a key role in evaluating exploration and development prospects. Properly designed well tests can provide reservoir engineers with reservoir pressure, reserves (minimum economic or total), and flow capacity, all of which are essential in the reservoir evalu- ation process. Some of the results one can obtain from pressure transient testing include the following: .Initial reservoir pressure .Average reservoir pressure .Directional permeability .Radial effective permeability changes from the wellbore .Gas condensate fallout effect on flowDepthTemperature % flow from spinner flowmeter150 02 55 07 5 100160 sp g - ray 7100 7150 7200 7250 7300 Fill 7350Zone A Zone B Zone C Figure 15.1 Temperature and spinner flowmeter-derived production profile (Economides et al., 1994).15/228 PRODUCTION ENHANCEMENT.Near wellbore damage/stimulation .Rate-dependent skin .Boundary identification .Partial penetration effect on flow .Effective fracture length .Effective fracture conductivity .Dual-porosity characteristics (storativity and transmis- sivity ratios) The theoretical basis of pressure transient data analysis is beyond the scope of this book. It can be found elsewhere (Chaudhry, 2004; Horne, 1995; Lee et al., 2003). Modern computer software packages are available for data anal- yses. These packages include PanSystem (EPS, 2004) and F.A.S.T. WellTest (Fekete, 2003). The following subsec- tions briefly present some principles of data analyses that lead to deriving reservoir properties directly affecting well productivity. Reservoir Pressure . Reservoir pressure is a key param- eter controlling well deliverability. A simple way to deter- mine the magnitude of initial reservoir pressure may be the Horner plot of data from pressure buildup test if the reservoir boundary was not reached during the test. If the boundary effects are seen, the average reservoir pressure can be estimated on the basis of the extrapolated initial reservoir pressure from Horner plot and the MBH plot (Dake, 2002). Effective Permeability . The effective reservoir perme- ability that controls the well’s deliverability should be derived from the flow regime that prevails in the reservoir for long-term production. To better understand the flow regimes, the commonly used equations describing flow in oil reservoirs are summarized first in this subsection. Similar equations for gas reservoirs can be found in Lee et al. (2003). Horizontal Radial Flow . For vertical wells fully pene- trating nonfractured reservoirs, the horizontal radial flow can be mathematically described in consistent units as pwf¼pi/C0qBm 4pkhhlnkht fmctr2 w/C18/C19 þ2Sþ0:80907/C20/C21 , (15 :1) where pwf¼flowing bottom-hole pressure pi¼initial reservoir pressure q¼volumetric liquid production rate B¼formation volume factor m¼fluid viscosity kh¼the average horizontal permeability h¼pay zone thickness t¼flow time f¼initial reservoir pressure ct¼total reservoir compressibilityrw¼wellbore radius S¼total skin factor. Horizontal Linear Flow . For hydraulically fractured wells, the horizontal linear flow can be mathematically described in consistent units as pwf¼pi/C0qBm 2pkyhﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ pkyt fmctx2 fs þS\"# , (15 :2) where xfis fracture half-length and kyis the permeability in the direction perpendicular to the fracture face. Vertical Radial Flow . For horizontal wells as depicted in Fig. 15.2, the early-time vertical radial flow can be mathematically described in consistent units as pwf¼pi/C0qBm 4pkyzLlnkyzt fmctr2 w/C18/C19 þ2Sþ0:80907/C20/C21 , (15 :3) where Lis the horizontal wellbore length and kyzis the geometric mean of horizontal and vertical permeabilities, that is, kyz¼ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ kykzp : (15:4) Horizontal Pseudo-Linear Flow . The pseudo-linear flow toward a horizontal wellbore can be mathematically described in consistent units as pwf¼pi/C0qBm 2pkyh/C0Zw ðÞﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ ﬃ 4pkyt fmctL2s þS\"# : (15:5) Horizontal Pseudo-Radial Flow . The pseudo-radial flow toward a horizontal wellbore can be mathematically described in consistent units as pwf¼pi/C0qBm 4pkhhlnkht fmctr2 w/C18/C19 þ2Sþ0:80907/C20/C21 :(15:6) For vertical wells fully penetrating nonfractured reser- voirs, it is usually the average (geometric mean) of hori- zontal permeabilities, kh, that dominates long-term production performance. This average horizontal perme- ability can be derived from the horizontal radial flow regime. For wells draining relatively small portions of hydraulically fractured reservoir segments, it is usually the permeability in the direction perpendicular to the frac- ture face that controls long-term production performance. This permeability can be derived from the horizontal lin- ear flow regime. For horizontal wells draining relatively large portions of nonfractured reservoir segments, it is usu- ally again the geometric mean of horizontal permeabilities xL yz h Zw Zwhz xy Figure 15.2 Notations for a horizontal wellbore.WELL PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION 15/229that dominates long-term production performance. This average horizontal permeability can be derived from the pseudo-radial flow regime. For vertical wells partially pene- trating nonfractured reservoirs, both horizontal and vertical permeabilities influence long-term production performance. These permeabilities can usually be derived from the hemi- spherical flow regime. Flow regimes are usually identified using the diagnostic pressure derivative p0defined as p0¼dDp dln (t)¼tdDp dt, (15 :7) where tis time and Dpis defined as Dp¼pi/C0pwf (15:8) for drawdown tests, where piandpwfare initial reservoir pressure and flowing bottom-hole pressure, respectively. For pressure buildup tests, the Dpis defined as Dp¼psw/C0pwfe, (15 :9) where pwsandpwfeare ship-in bottom-hole pressure and the flowing bottom-hole pressure at the end of flow (before shut-in), respectively. For any type of radial flow (e.g., horizontal radial flow, vertical radial flow, horizontal pseudo-radial flow), the diagnostic derivative is derived from Eqs. (15.1), (15.3), and (15.6) as p0¼dDp dln (t)¼qBm 4pkHR, (15 :10) where kis the average permeability in the flow plane ( khor kyz) and kh¼ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ kxkyp HRis the thickness of the radial flow ( horL). Apparently, the diagnostic derivative is constant over the radial flow time regime. The plot of p0versus tdata should show a trend of straight line parallel to the t-axis. For linear flow (e.g., flow toward a hydraulic fracture), the diagnostic derivative is derived from Eq. (15.2) as p0¼dDp dln (t)¼qB 4hxfﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ mt pfctkys : (15:12) For pseudo-linear flow (e.g., flow toward a horizontal well), the diagnostic derivative is derived from Eq.

Once the flow regimes are identified, permeabilities associated with the flow regime can be determined based on slope analyses. For any types of radial flow, Eqs. (15.1), (15.3), and (15.6) indicate that plotting of bottom-hole pressure versus time data on a semilog scale will show a trend with a constant slope mR, where mR¼/C0qBm 4pkHR: (15:16) Then the average permeability in the flow plane ( khorkyz) can be estimated byk¼/C0qBm 4pHRmR: (15:17) For any types of linear flow, Eqs.

Skin Factor . Skin factor is a constant that is used to adjust the flow equation derived from the ideal condition (homogeneous and isotropic porous media) to suit the applications in nonideal conditions. It is an empirical fac- tor employed to consider the lumped effects of several aspects that are not considered in the theoretical basis when the flow equations were derived. The value of the skin factor can be derived from pressure transient test analysis with Eqs. (15.1), (15.2), (15.3), (15.5), and (15.6). But its value has different meanings depending on flow regime. A general expression of the skin factor is S¼SDþSCþuþSPþX SPS, (15 :22) where SDis damage skin during drilling, cementing, well completion, fluid injection, and even oil and gas produc- tion. Physically, it is due to plugging of pore space by external or internal solid particles and fluids. This com- ponent of skin factor can be removed or averted with well stimulation operations. The SCþuis a skin component due to partial completion and deviation angle, which make the flow pattern near the wellbore deviate from ideal radial flow pattern. This skin component is not removable in water coning and gas coning systems. The SPis a skin component due to the nonideal flow condition around the perforations associated with cased-hole completion. It depends on a number of parameters including perforation density, phase angle, perforation depth, diameter, com- pacted zone, and others. This component can be mini- mized with optimized perorating technologies. The SSPS represents pseudo-skin components due to non–Darcy flow effect, multiphase effect, and flow convergence near the wellbore. These components cannot be eliminated. It is essential to know the magnitude of components of the skin factor Sderived from the pressure transient test data analysis. Commercial software packages are available for decomposition of the skin factor on the basis of well completion method. One of the packages is WellFlo (EPS, 2005). Example Problem 15.1 A horizontal wellbore was placed in a 100-ft thick oil reservoir of 0.23 porosity. Oil formation15/230 PRODUCTION ENHANCEMENTvolume factor and viscosity are 1.25 rb/stb and 1 cp, respectively. The total reservoir compressibility factor is 10/C05psi/C01. The well was tested following the schedule shown in Fig. 15.3. The measured flowing bottom-hole pressures are also presented in Fig. 15.3. Estimate directional permeabilities and skin factors from the test data. Solution Figure 15.4 presents a log-log diagnostic plot of test data. It clearly indicates a vertical radial flow at early time, a pseudo-linear flow at mid-time, and the beginning of a pseudo-radial flow at late time. The semi-log analysis for the vertical radial flow is shown in Fig. 15.5, which gives kyz¼0:9997 md and near-wellbore skin factor S¼/C00:0164. The square-root time plot analysis for the pseudo-linear flow is shown in Fig. 15.6, which gives the effective well- bore length of L¼1,082 :75 ft and a skin factor due to convergence of S¼3:41. The semi-log analysis for the horizontal pseudo-radial flow is shown in Fig. 15.7, which gives kh¼1:43 md and pseudo-skin factor S¼/C06:17. Figure 15.8 shows a match between the measured and model-calculated pressure responses given by an optimiza- tion technique. This match was obtained using the following parameter values: kh¼1:29 md kz¼0:80 md S¼0:06 L¼1,243 ft : To estimate the long-term productivity of this horizontal well, the kh¼1:29 md and S¼0:06 should be used in the well inflow equation presented in Chapter 3. 15.3 Excessive Gas Production Excessive gas production is usually due to channeling be- hind the casing (Fig. 15.9), preferential flow through high- permeability zones (Fig. 15.10), gas coning (Fig. 15.11), and casing leaks (Clark and Schultz, 1956).The channeling behind the casing and gas coning prob- lems can be identified based on production logging such as temperature and noise logs. An example is depicted in Fig. 15.12, where both logs indicate that gas is being produced from an upper gas sand and channeling down to some perforations in the oil zone. Excessive gas production of an oil well could also be due to gas production from unexpected gas zones. This can be identified using production logging such as temperature and density logs. An example is presented in Fig. 15.13, where both logs indicate gas production from the thief zone B. 15.4 Excessive Water Production Excessive water production is usually from water zones, not from the connate water in the pay zone. Water enters the wellbore due to channeling behind the casing (Fig. 15.14), preferential flow through high-permeability zones (Fig. 15.15), water coning (Fig. 15.16), hydraulic fracturing into water zones, and casing leaks. Figure 15.17 shows how to identify fracture height using prefracture and postfracture temperature logs to tell whether the hydraulic fracture has extended into a water zone. In addition to those production logging tools that are mentioned in the previous section, other production log- ging tools can be used for identifying water-producing zones. Fluid density logs are especially useful for identify- ing water entries. Comparison between water-cut data and spinner flowmeter log can sometimes give an idea of where the water is coming from. Figure 15.18 shows a spinner flowmeter log identifying a watered zone at the bottom of a well with a water-cut of nearly 50%. 15.5 Liquid Loading of Gas Wells Gas wells usually produce natural gas-carrying liquid water and/or condensate in the form of mist. As the gas flow velocity in the well drops because of reservoir pres- sure depletion, the carrying capacity of the gas decreases. Figure 15.3 Measured bottom-hole pressures and oil production rates during a pressure drawdown test.WELL PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION 15/231When the gas velocity drops to a critical level, liquids begin to accumulate in the well and the well flow can undergo an annular flow regime followed by a slug flow regime. The accumulation of liquids (liquid loading) increases the bottom-hole pressure, which reduces gas production rate. A low gas production rate will cause gas velocity to drop further. Eventually, the well will undergo a bubbly flow regime and cease producing. Several measures can be taken to solve the liquid-loading problem. Foaming the liquid water can enable the gas to lift water from the well. Using smaller tubing or creating a lower wellhead pressure sometimes can keep mist flowing. The well can be unloaded by gas-lifting or pumping the liquids out of the well. Heating the wellbore can prevent oil condensation. Down-hole injection of water into anunderlying disposal zone is another option. However, liquid-loading is not always obvious and recognizing the liquid-loading problem is not an easy task. A thorough diagnostic analysis of well data needs to be performed. The symptoms to look for include onset of liquid slugs at the surface of well, increasing difference between the tubing and casing pressures with time, sharp changes in gradient on a flowing pressure survey, and sharp drops in production decline curve. 15.5.1 The Turner et al. Method Turner et al. (1969) were the pioneer investigators who analyzed and predicted the minimum gas flow rate to prevent liquid-loading.

On the basis of analyses on field data, they con- cluded that the film-movement model does not represent the controlling liquid transport mechanism. Turner et al.’s entrained drop movement model was de- rived on the basis of the terminal free settling velocity of liquid drops and the maximum drop diameter correspondingto the critical Weber number of 30. Turner et al.’s terminal slip velocity equation is expressed in U.S. field units as vsl¼1:3s1=4rL/C0rg/C16/C171=4 C1=4 dr1=2 g: (15:23) According to Turner et al., gas will continuously remove liquids from the well until its velocity drops to below the Figure 15.6 Square-root time plot for pseudo-linear flow analysis.

The minimum gas flow rate (in MMcf/D) for a particular set of conditions (pressure and conduit geometry) can be calculated using Eqs. (15.23) and (15.24): QgslMM ¼3:06pvslA Tz(15:24) Figure 15.19 shows a comparison between the results of Turner et al.’s entrained drop movement model. The map shows many loaded points in the unloaded region. Turner et al. recommended the equation-derived values be adjusted upward by approximately 20% to ensure removal of all drops. Turner et al. believed that the discrepancy wasattributed to several facts including the use of drag coeffi- cients for solid spheres, the assumption of stagnation velo- city, and the critical Weber number established for drops falling in air, not in compressed gas. The main problem that hinders the application of Turner et al.’s entrained drop model to gas wells comes from the difficulties of estimating the values of fluid den- sity and pressure. Using an average value of gas-specific gravity (0.6) and gas temperature (120 8F), Turner et al. derived an expression for gas density as 0.0031 times the pressure. However, they did not present a method for calculating the gas pressure in a multiphase flow wellbore. Figure 15.8 Match between measured and model calculated pressure data.

Turner et al.’s entrained drop movement model was later modified by a number of authors. Coleman et al. (1991) suggested to use Eq. (15.23) with a lower constant value. Nosseir et al. (2000) expanded Turner et al.’s entrained drop model to more than one flow regime in a well. Lea and Nickens (2004) made some corrections to Turner et al.’s simplified equations. However, the original drawbacks (neglected transport velocity and multiphase flow pressure) with Turner et al.’s approach still remain unsolved. 15.5.2 The Guo et al. Method Starting from Turner et al.’s entrained drop model, Guo et al. (2006) determined the minimum kinetic energy of gas that is required to lift liquids. A four-phase (gas, oil, water, and solid particles) mist-flow model was developed. Applying the minimum kinetic energy criterion to thefour-phase flow model resulted in a closed-form analytical equation for predicting the minimum gas flow rate. 15.5.2.1 Minimum Kinetic Energy Kinetic energy per unit volume of gas can be expressed as Ek¼rgv2 g 2gc: (15:25) Substituting Eq. (15.23) into Eq.

This yields the minimum kinetic energy value of 2 :5l b f-ft=ft3. In gas wells producing conden- sate, typical values for condensate–gas interfacial tension and condensate density are 20 dynes/cm and 45 lb m=ft3, respectively. This yields the minimum kinetic energy value of 1:2l b f-ft=ft3. The minimum gas velocity required for transporting the liquid droplets upward is equal to the minimum gas ve- locity required for floating the liquid droplets (keeping thedroplets from falling) plus the transport velocity of the droplets, that is, vgm¼vslþvtr: (15:28) The transport velocity vtrmay be calculated on the basis of liquid production rate, geometry of the conduit, and liquid volume fraction, which is difficult to quantify. Instead of trying to formulate an expression for the transport velocity vtr, Guo et al. used vtras an empir- ical constant to lump the effects of nonstagnation ve- locity, drag coefficients for solid spheres, and the critical Weber number established for drops falling in air.

For typical gas wells producing condensate, this equation gives the minimum kinetic energy value of 1 :73 lb f-ft=ft3. These numbers imply that the required minimum gas pro- duction rate in water-producing gas wells is approximately twice that in condensate-producing gas wells. To evaluate the gas kinetic energy Ekin Eq. (15.25) at a given gas flow rate and compare it with the minimum required kinetic energy Ekmin Eq. (15.30), the values of gas density rgand gas velocity vgneed to be determined.Expressions for rgandvgcan be obtained from ideal gas law: rg¼2:7Sgp T(15:31) vg¼4:71/C210/C02TQG Aip(15:32) Substituting Eqs.

This analysis is consistent with the observations from air- drilling operations where solid particles accumulate at the bottom-hole rather than at the top-hole. However, this analysis is in contradiction with the results by Turner et al., which indicated that the wellhead conditions are in most instances, controlling.

If the Ekis greater than Ekm, the QGis higher than the Qgm. The value of QGshould be reduced and the calculation should be repeated until the Ekis very close to Ekm. Because this procedure is tedious, a simple equation was derived by Guo et al. for predicting the minimum required gas flow rate in this section. Under the minimum unloaded condition (the last point of the mist flow regime), Eq. (15.33) becomes Ekm¼9:3/C210/C05SgTbhQgm2 A2 ip, (15 :43) which gives p¼9:3/C210/C05SgTbhQgm2 A2 iEkm: (15:44)Substituting Eq. (15.44) into Eq.

The minimum required gas flow rate Qgmcan be solved from Eq. (15.45) with a trial-and-error or numerical method such as the Bisection method. It can be shown that Eq. (15.45) is a one-to-one function of Qgmfor Qgmvalues greater than zero. Therefore, the Newton– Raphson iteration technique can also be used for solving Qgm. Commercial software packages such as MS Excel can be used as solvers. In fact, the Goal Seek function built into MS Excel was used for generating solutions presented in this chapter. The spreadsheet program is named GasWellLoading.xls . Example Problem 15.2 To demonstrate how to use Eq. (15.45) for predicting the minimum unloading gas flow rate, consider a vertical gas well producing 0.70 specific gravity gas and 50 bbl/day condensate through a 2.441-in. inside diameter (ID) tubing against a wellhead pressure of 900 psia. Suppose the tubing string is set at a depth of 10,000 ft, and other data are given in Table 15.1.

Methods Figure 15.20 illustrates Eq. (15.45)–calculated minimum flow rates mapped against the test flow rates for the same wells used in Fig. 15.19. This map shows six loaded points in the unloaded region, but they are very close to the boundary. This means the Guo et al. method is more accurate than the Turner et al. method in estimating the minimum flow rates.Summary This chapter presents a guideline to identifying problems commonly encountered in oil and gas wells. Well test analysis provides a means of estimating properties of indi- vidual pay zones. Production logging analysis identifies fluid entries to the wellbore from different zones. The Guo et al. method is more accurate than the Turner et al. method for predicting liquid-loading problems in gas pro- duction wells. References chaudhry ,a.c.Oil Well Testing Handbook .

In the treatment, acid solution is injected into the formation to dissolve some of the minerals to recover per- meability of sandstones (removing skin) or increase per- meability of carbonates near the wellbore. After a brief introduction to acid–rock interaction, this chapter focuses on important issues on sandstone acidizing design and carbonate acidizing design. More in-depth information can be found from Economides and Nolte (2000). 16.2 Acid–Rock Interaction Minerals that are present in sandstone pores include mont- morillonite (bentonite), kaolinite, calcite, dolomite, sider- ite, quartz, albite (sodium feldspar), orthoclase, and others. These minerals can be either from invasion of external fluid during drilling, cementing, and well comple- tion or from host materials that exist in the naturally occurring rock formations. The most commonly used acids for dissolving these minerals are hydrochloric acid (HCl) and hydrofluoric acid (HF). 16.2.1 Primary Chemical Reactions Silicate minerals such as clays and feldspars in sandstone pores are normally removed using mixtures of HF and HCl, whereas carbonate minerals are usually attacked with HCl. The chemical reactions are summarized in Table 16.1. The amount of acid required to dissolve a given amount of mineral is determined by the stoichiom- etry of the chemical reaction. For example, the simple reaction between HCl and CaCO 3requires that 2 mol of HCl is needed to dissolve 1 mol of CaCO 3. 16.2.2 Dissolving Power of Acids A more convenient way to express reaction stoichiometry is the dissolving power. The dissolving power on a mass basis is called gravimetric dissolving power and is defined as b¼CanmMW m naMW a, (16 :1) where b¼gravimetric dissolving power of acid solution, lb mmineral =lbmsolution Ca¼weight fraction of acid in the acid solution nm¼stoichiometry number of mineral na¼stoichiometry number of acid MW m= molecular weight of mineral MW a¼molecular weight of acid.

The reaction rate can be evaluated experimentally and described by kinetics models. Research work in this area has been presented by many investigators including Fogler et al. (1976), Lund et al. (1973, 1975), Hill et al. (1981), Kline and Fogler (1981), and Schechter (1992). Generally, the reaction rate is affected by the characteristics of mineral, properties of acid, reservoir temperature, and rates of acid transport to the mineral surface and removal of product from the surface. Detailed discussion of reaction kinetics is beyond the scope of this book. 16.3 Sandstone Acidizing Design The purpose of sandstone acidizing is to remove the dam- age to the sandstone near the wellbore that occurred dur- ing drilling and well completion processes. The acid treatment is only necessary when it is sure that formation damage is significant to affect well productivity. A major formation damage is usually indicated by a large positive skin factor derived from pressure transit test analysis in a flow regime of early time (see Chapter 15). 16.3.1 Selection of Acid The acid type and acid concentration in acid solution used in acidizing is selected on the basis of minerals in the formation and field experience. For sandstones, the typical treatments usually consist of a mixture of 3 wt% HF and 12 wt% HCl, preceded by a 15 wt% HCl preflush. McLeod (1984) presented a guideline to the selection of acid on the basis of extensive field experience. His recommendations for sandstone treatments are shown in Table 16.2. McLeod’s recommendation should serve only as a starting point. When many wells are treated in a particular forma- tion, it is worthwhile to conduct laboratory tests of the responses of cores to different acid strengths. Figure 16.1 shows typical acid–response curves.

Selection of an optimum acid volume is complicated by the competing effects. The volume of acid needed depends strongly on the depth of the damaged zone, which is seldom known. Also, the acid will never be distributed equally to all parts of the damaged forma- tion. The efficiency of acid treatment and, therefore, acid volume also depends on acid injection rate. To ensure that an adequate amount of acid contacts most of the damaged formation, a larger amount of acid is necessary. The acid preflush volume is usually determined on the basis of void volume calculations. The required minimum acid volume is expressed as Va¼Vm XþVPþVm, (16 :3) where Va¼the required minimum acid volume, ft3 Vm¼volume of minerals to be removed, ft3 VP¼initial pore volume, ft3and Vm¼pr2 a/C0r2 w/C0/C1 1/C0fðÞ Cm, (16 :4) VP¼pr2 a/C0r2 w/C0/C1 f, (16 :5) where ra¼radius of acid treatment, ft rw¼radius of wellbore, ft f¼porosity, fraction Cm¼mineral content, volume fraction. Example Problem 16.1 A sandstone with a porosity of 0.2 containing 10 v% calcite (CaCO 3) is to be acidized with HF/HCl mixture solution. A preflush of 15 wt% HCl solution is to be injected ahead of the mixture to dissolve the carbonate minerals and establish a low pH environment. If the HCl preflush is to remove all carbonates in a region within 1 ft beyond a 0.328-ft radius wellbore before the HF/HCl stage enters the formation, what minimum preflush volume is required in terms of gallon per foot of pay zone?

Economides and Nolte (2000) provide a listing of typical stage sequences and volumes for sandstone acidizing treatments. For HCl acid, the volume requirement increases from 50 to 200 gal/ft pay zone with HCl solubility of HF changing from less than 5% to 20%. For HF acid, the volume requirement is in the range of 75–100 gal/ft pay zone with 3.0–13.5% HCl and 0.5–3.0% HF depending on mineralogy. Numerous efforts have been made to develop a rigorous method for calculating the minimum required acid volume in the past 2 decades. The most commonly used method is the two-mineral model (Hekim et al., 1982; Hill et al., 1981; Taha et al., 1989). This model requires a numerical tech- nique to obtain a general solution. Schechter (1992) pre- sented an approximate solution that is valid for Damkohler number being greater than 10. This solution approximates the HF fast-reacting mineral front as a sharp front. Readers are referred to Schechter (1992) for more information. Because mud acid treatments do not dissolve much of the formation minerals but dissolve the materials clogging the pore throats, Economides and Nolte (2000) suggest taking the initial pour volume (Eq. [16.5]) within the radius of treat- mentasthe minimumrequiredacidvolume forthemain stage of acidizing treatment. Additional acid volume should be considered for the losses in the injection tubing string. 16.3.3 Acid Injection Rate Acid injection rate should be selected on the basis of mineral dissolution and removal and depth of damaged zone. Selecting an optimum injection rate is a difficult process because the damaged zone is seldom known with any accuracy and the competing effects of mineral disso-lution and reaction product precipitation. Fortunately, research results have shown that acidizing efficiency is relatively insensitive to acid injection rate and that the highest rate possible yields the best results. McLeod (1984) recommends relatively low injection rates based on the observation that acid contact time with the forma- tion of 2–4 hours appears to give good results. da Motta (1993) shows that with shallow damage, acid injection rate has little effect on the residual skin after 100 gal/ft of injection rate; and with deeper damage, the higher the injection rate, the lower the residual skin. Paccaloni et al. (1988) and Paccaloni and Tambini (1990) also report high success rates in numerous field treatments using the high- est injection rates possible. There is always an upper limit on the acid injection rate that is imposed by formation breakdown (fracture) pres- sure pbd. Assuming pseudo–steady-state flow, the max- imum injection rate limited by the breakdown pressure is expressed as qi,max¼4:917/C210/C06kh p bd/C0p/C0Dpsf/C0/C1 maln0:472re rwþS/C16/C17 , (16 :6) where qi¼maximum injection rate, bbl/min k¼permeability of undamaged formation, md h¼thickness of pay zone to be treated, ft pbd¼formation breakdown pressure, psia p¼reservoir pressure, psia Dpsf¼safety margin, 200 to 500 psi ma¼viscosity of acid solution, cp re¼drainage radius, ft rw¼wellbore radius, ft S¼skin factor, ft. The acid injection rate can also be limited by surface injection pressure at the pump available to the treatment. This effect is described in the next section. 16.3.4 Acid Injection Pressure In most acid treatment operations, only the surface tubing pressure is monitored. It is necessary to predict the surface injection pressure at the design stage for pump selection. The surface tubing pressure is related to the bottom-hole flowing pressure by psi¼pwf/C0DphþDpf, (16 :7) where psi¼surface injection pressure, psia pwf¼flowing bottom-hole pressure, psia Dph¼hydrostatic pressure drop, psia Dpf¼frictional pressure drop, psia. The second and the third term in the right-hand side of Eq. (16.7) can be calculated using Eq. (11.93). However, to avert the procedure of friction factor determination, the following approximation may be used for the frictional pressure drop calculation (Economides and Nolte, 2000): Dpf¼518r0:79q1:79m0:207 1,000 D4:79L, (16 :8) where r¼density of fluid, g =cm3 q¼injection rate, bbl/min m¼fluid viscosity, cp D¼tubing diameter, in.

The formation fracture gradient is 0.7 psi/ft. The wellbore radius is 0.328 ft. Assuming a reservoir pressure of 4,000 psia, drainage area radius of 1,000 ft, and a skin factor of 15, calculate (a) the maximum acid injection rate using safety margin 300 psi.

Figure 16.2 shows wormholes created by acid dissolution of limestone in a laboratory (Hoefner and Fogler, 1988). Carbonate acidizing is a more difficult process to pre- dict than sandstone acidizing because the physics is much more complex. Because the surface reaction rates are very high and mass transfer often plays the role of limiting step locally, highly nonuniform dissolution patterns are usually created. The structure of the wormholes depends on many factors including flow geometry, injection rate, reaction kinetics, and mass transfer rates. Acidizing de- sign relies on mathematical models calibrated by labora- tory data. 16.4.1 Selection of Acid HCl is the most widely used acid for carbonate matrix acidizing. Weak acids are suggested for perforating fluid and perforation cleanup, and strong acids are recom- mended for other treatments. Table 16.3 lists recom- mended acid type and strength for carbonate acidizing (McLeod, 1984). All theoretical models of wormhole propagation predict deeper penetration for higher acid strengths, so a high concentration of acid is always preferable.16.4.2 Acidizing Parameters Acidizing parameters include acid volume, injection rate, and injection pressure. The acid volume can be calculated with two methods: (1) Daccord’s wormhole propagation model and (2) the volumetric model, on the basis of desired penetration of wormholes. The former is optimistic, whereas the latter is more realistic (Economides et al., 1994). Based on the wormhole propagation model presented by Daccord et al. (1989), the required acid volume per unit thickness of formation can be estimated using the follow- ing equation: Vh¼pfD2=3q1=3 hrdf wh bNAc(16:9) where Vh¼required acid volume per unit thickness of formation, m3=m f¼porosity, fraction D¼molecular diffusion coefficient, m2=s qh¼injection rate per unit thickness of formation, m3=sec-m rwh¼desired radius of wormhole penetration, m df¼1:6, fractal dimension b¼105/C210/C05in SI units NAc¼acid capillary number, dimensionless, where the acid capillary number is defined as NAc¼fbga (1/C0f)gm, (16 :10) Figure 16.2 Wormholes created by acid dissolution of limestone (Hoefner and Fogler, 1988; courtesy AIChE).

Based on the volumetric model, the required acid volume per unit thickness of formation can be estimated using the following equation: Vh¼pfr2 wh/C0r2 w/C0/C1 PVðÞbt, (16 :11) where ( PV)btis the number of pore volumes of acid injected at the time of wormhole breakthrough at the end of the core. Apparently, the volumetric model requires data from laboratory tests. Example Problem 16.3 A 28 wt% HCl is needed to propagate wormholes 3 ft from a 0.328-ft radius wellbore in a limestone formation (specific gravity 2.71) with a porosity of 0.15. The designed injection rate is 0.1 bbl/ min-ft, the diffusion coefficient is 10/C09m2=sec, and the density of the 28% HCl is 1 :14 g=cm3. In linear core floods, 1.5 pore volume is needed for wormhole breakthrough at the end of the core. Calculate the acid volume requirement using (a) Daccord’s model and (b) the volumetric model. Solution (a) Daccord’s model: b¼CaymMW m yaMW a¼(0:28)(1)(100 :1) (2)(36 :5) ¼0:3836 lb mCaCO 3=lbm28 wt %HCl solution : NAc¼fbga (1/C0f)gm¼(0:15)(0 :3836)(1 :14) (1/C00:15)(2 :71)¼0:0285 qh¼0:1 bbl =min -ft ¼8:69/C210/C04m3=sec-m rwh¼0:328þ3¼3:328 ft ¼1:01 m Vh¼pfD2=3q1=3 hrdf wh bNAc ¼p(0:15)(10/C09)2=3(8:69/C210/C04)1=3(1:01)1:6 (1:5/C210/C05)(0:0285) ¼0:107 m3=m¼8:6 gal =ft (b) Volumetric model: Vh¼pfr2 wh/C0r2 w/C0/C1 PVðÞbt ¼p(0:15)(3 :3282/C00:3282)(1:5) ¼7:75 ft3=ft¼58 gal =ft: This example shows that the Daccord model gives opti- mistic results and the volumetric model gives more realistic results. The maximum injection rate and pressure for carbon- ate acidizing can be calculated the same way as that for sandstone acidizing. Models of wormhole propagation predict that wormhole velocity increases with injection rate to the power of1⁄2to 1. Therefore, the maximum injection rate is preferable. However, this approach may require more acid volume. If the acid volume is con- strained, a slower injection rate may be preferable. If a sufficient acid volume is available, the maximum injection rate is recommended for limestone formations. However, a lower injection rate may be preferable for dolomites. This allows the temperature of the acid entering the for- mation to increase, and thus, the reaction rate increases.The designed acid volume and injection rate should be adjusted based on the real-time monitoring of pressure during the treatment.

Hydraulic fracturing jobs are carried out at well sites using heavy equipment including truck-mounted pumps, blenders, fluid tanks, and proppant tanks. Figure 17.1 illustrates a simplified equipment layout in hydraulic frac- turing treatments of oil and gas wells. A hydraulic fractur- ing job is divided into two stages: the pad stage and the slurry stage (Fig. 17.2). In the pad stage, fracturing fluid only is injected into the well to break down the formation and create a pad. The pad is created because the fracturing fluid injection rate is higher than the flow rate at which the fluid can escape into the formation. After the pad grows to a desirable size, the slurry stage is started. During the slurry stage, the fracturing fluid is mixed with sand/proppant in a blender and the mixture is injected into the pad/fracture. After filling the fracture with sand/proppant, the fracturing job is over and the pump is shut down. Apparently, toreduce the injection rate requirement, a low leaf-off frac- turing fluid is essential. Also, to prop the fracture, the sand/ proppant should have a compressive strength that is high enough to resist the stress from the formation. This chapter concisely describes hydraulic fracturing treatments. For detailed information on this subject, see Economides and Nolte (2000). This chapter focuses on the following topics: .Formation fracturing pressure .Fracture geometry .Productivity of fractured wells .Hydraulic fracturing design .Post-frac evaluation 17.2 Formation Fracturing Pressure Formation fracturing pressure is also called breakdown pressure . It is one of the key parameters used in hydraulic fracturing design. The magnitude of the parameter de- pends on formation depth and properties. Estimation of the parameter value begins with in situ stress analysis.

Whereas both cases have been evidenced based on the information collected from tiltmeters and microseismic data, it is commonly accepted that each individual fracture is sheet-like. However, the shape of the fracture varies as predicted by different models. 17.3.1 Radial Fracture Model A simple radial (penny-shaped) crack/fracture was first presented by Sneddon and Elliot (1946). This occurs when there are no barriers constraining height growth or when a horizontal fracture is created. Geertsma and de Klerk (1969) presented a radial fracture model showing that the fracture width at wellbore is given byww¼2:56mqi1/C0nðÞ R E/C20/C21 1 4 , (17 :6) where ww¼fracture width at wellbore, in. m¼fluid viscosity, cp qi¼pumping rate, bpm R¼the radius of the fracture, ft E¼Young’s modulus, psi. Assuming the fracture width drops linearly in the radial direction, the average fracture width may be expressed as w¼0:85mqi1/C0nðÞ R E/C20/C21 1 4 : (17:7) 17.3.2 The KGD Model Assuming that a fixed-height vertical fracture is propagated in a well-confined pay zone (i.e., the stresses in the layers above and below the pay zone are large enough to prevent fracture growth out of the pay zone), Khristianovich and Zheltov (1955) presented a fracture model as shown in Fig. 17.5. The model assumes that the width of the crack at any distance from the well is independent of vertical position, which is a reasonable approximation for a frac- ture with height much greater than its length. Their solution included the fracture mechanics aspects of the fracture tip. They assumed that the flow rate in the fracture was con- stant, and that the pressure in the fracture could be approxi- mated by a constant pressure in the majority of the fracture body, except for a small region near the tip with no fluid penetration, and hence, no fluid pressure. This concept of fluid lag has remained an element of the mechanics of the fracture tip. Geertsma and de Klerk (1969) gave a much simpler solution to the same problem. The solution is now referred to as the KGD model .

Nordgren (1972) added leakoff and storage within the fracture (due to increasing width) to the Perkins and Kern model, deriving what is now known as the PKN model . The average width of the PKN fracture is expressed as w¼0:3qim1/C0nðÞ xf G/C20/C211=4p 4g/C16/C17 , (17 :9) where g/C250:75. It is important to emphasize that even for contained fractures, the PKN solution is only valid when the fracture length is at least three times the height. The three models discussed in this section all assume that the fracture is planar, that is, fracture propagates in a particular direction (perpendicular to the minimum stress), fluid flow is one-dimensional along the length (or radius) of the fracture, and leakoff behavior is governed by a simple expression derived from filtration theory. The rock in which the fracture propagates is assumed to be a continuous, homogeneous, isotropic linear elastic solid, and the fracture is considered to be of fixed height (PKN and KGD) or completely confined in a given layer (radial). The KGD and PKN models assume respectively that the fracture height is large or small relative to length, while the radial model assumes a circular shape. Since these models were developed, numerous extensions have been made, which have relaxed these assumptions. 17.3.4 Three-Dimensional and Pseudo-3D Models The planar 2D models discussed in the previous section are deviated with significant simplifying assumptions. Although their accuracies are limited, they are useful for understanding the growth of hydraulic fractures. The power of modern computer allows routine treatment designs to be made with more complex models, which are solved numerically. The biggest limitation of the simplemodels is the requirement to specify the fracture height or to assume that a radial fracture will develop. It is not always obvious from data such as logs where, or whether, the fracture will be contained. In addition, the fracture height will usually vary from the well to the tip of the fracture, as the pressure varies. There are two major types of pseudo–three-dimensional (P3D) models: lumped andcell based . In the lumped (or elliptical) models, the fracture shape is assumed to consist of two half-ellipses joined at the center. The horizontal length and wellbore vertical tip extensions are calculated at each time-step, and the assumed shape is made to match these positions. Fluid flow is assumed to occur along streamlines from the perforations to the edge of the ellipse, with the shape of the streamlines derived from simple analytical solutions. In cell-based models, the fracture shape is not prescribed. The fracture is treated as a series of connected cells, which are linked only via the fluid flow from cell to cell. The height at any cross-section is calcu- lated from the pressure in that cell, and fluid flow in the vertical direction is generally approximated. Lumped models were first introduced by Cleary (1980), and numerous papers have since been presented on their use (e.g., Cleary et al., 1994). As stated in the 1980 paper, ‘‘The heart of the formulae can be extracted very simply by a non-dimensionalization of the governing equations; the remainder just involves a good physics-mathematical choice of the undetermined coefficients.’’ The lumped models implicitly require the assumption of a self-similar fracture shape (i.e., one that is the same as time evolves, except for length scale). The shape is generally assumed to consist of two half-ellipses of equal lateral extent, but with different vertical extent. In cell-based P3D models, the fracture length is discre- tized into cells along the length of the fracture. Because only one direction is discretized and fluid flow is assumed to be essentially horizontal along the length of the fracture, the model can be solved much more easily than planar 3D models. Although these models allow the calculation of fracture height growth, the assumptions make them pri- marily suitable for reasonably contained fractures, with length much greater than height. Figure 17.6 The PKN fracture geometry.HYDRAULIC FRACTURING 17/255Planar 3D models : The geometry of a hydraulic fracture is defined by its width and the shape of its periphery (i.e., height at any distance from the well and length). The width distri- bution and the overall shape change as the treatment is pumped, and during closure. They depend on the pressure distribution, which itself is determined by the pressure gra- dients caused by the fluid flow within the fracture. The relation between pressure gradient and flow rate is very sensitive to fracture width, resulting in a tightly coupled calculation. Although the mechanics of these processes can be described separately, this close coupling complicates the solution of any fracture model. The nonlinear relation be- tween width and pressure and the complexity of a moving- boundary problem further complicate numerical solutions. Clifton and Abou-Sayed (1979) reported the first numerical implementation of a planar model. The solution starts with a small fracture, initiated at the perforations, divided into a number of equal elements (typically 16 squares). The ele- ments then distort to fit the evolving shape. The elements can develop large aspect ratios and very small angles, which are not well handled by the numerical schemes typically used to solve the model. Barree (1983) developed a model that does not show grid distortion. The layered reservoir is divided into a grid of equal-size rectangular elements, over the entire region that the fracture may cover. Simulators based on such models are much more com- putationally demanding than P3D-based simulators, be- cause they solve the fully 2D fluid-flow equations and couple this solution rigorously to the elastic-deformation equations. The elasticity equations are also solved more rigorously, using a 3D solution rather than 2D slices. Computational power and numerical methods have im- proved to the point that these models are starting to be used for routine designs. They should be used whenever a significant portion of the fracture volume is outside the zone where the fracture initiates or where there is signifi- cant vertical fluid flow. Such cases typically arise when the stress in the layers around the pay zone is similar to or lower than that within the pay. Regardless of which type of model is used to calculate the fracture geometry, limited data are available on typical treatments to validate the model used. On commercial treatments, the pressure history during the treatment is usually the only data available to validate the model. Even in these cases, the quality of the data is questionable if the bottom-hole pressure must be inferred from the surface pressure. The bottom-hole pressure is also not sufficient to uniquely determine the fracture geometry in the absence of other information, such as that derived from tiltmeters and microseismic data. If a simulator incorporates the correct model, it should match both treating pressure and fracture geometry.Table 17.1 summarizes main features of fracture models in different categories. Commercial packages are listed in Table 17.2. 17.4 Productivity of Fractured Wells Hydraulically created fractures gather fluids from reser- voir matrix and provide channels for the fluid to flow into wellbores. Apparently, the productivity of fractured wells depends on two steps: (1) receiving fluids from formation and (2) transporting the received fluid to the wellbore. Usually one of the steps is a limiting step that controls the well-production rate. The efficiency of the first step depends on fracture dimension (length and height), and the efficiency of the second step depends on fracture per- meability. The relative importance of each of the steps can be analyzed using the concept of fracture conductivity defined as (Argawal et al., 1979; Cinco-Ley and Sama- niego, 1981): FCD¼kfw kxf, (17:10) where FCD¼fracture conductivity, dimensionless kf¼fracture permeability, md w¼fracture width, ft xf¼fracture half-length, ft.

Settari17/256 PRODUCTION ENHANCEMENTIn the situations in which the fracture dimension is much less than the drainage area of the well, the long-term productivity of the fractured well can be estimated assum- ing pseudo-radial flow in the reservoir.

The fold of increase can be expressed as J Jo¼lnre rw lnre rwþSf, (17 :12) where J¼productivity of fractured well, stb/day-psi Jo¼productivity of nonfractured well, stb/day-psi. The effective skin factor Sfcan be determined based on fracture conductivity and Fig. 17.7. It is seen from Fig. 17.7 that the parameter Sfþlnxf=rw/C0/C1 approaches a constant value in the range ofFCD>100, that is, which gives Sf/C250:7/C0lnxf=rw/C0/C1 , (17 :13) meaning that the equivalent skin factor of fractured wells depends only on fracture length for high-conductivity frac- tures, not fracture permeability and width. This is the situation in which the first step is the limiting step. On the other hand, Fig. 17.7 indicates that the parameter Sfþlnxf=rw/C0/C1 declines linearly with log ( FCD) in the range of FCD<1, that is, Sf/C251:52þ2:31 log rwðÞ /C0 1:545 logkfw k/C18/C19 /C00:765 log xf/C0/C1 : (17:14) Comparing the coefficients of the last two terms in this relation indicates that the equivalent skin factor of frac- tured well is more sensitive to the fracture permeability and width than to fracture length for low-conductivity fractures. This is the situation in which the second step is the limiting step.The previous analyses reveal that low-permeability res- ervoirs, leading to high-conductivity fractures, would benefit greatly from fracture length, whereas high-perme- ability reservoirs, naturally leading to low-conductivity fractures, require good fracture permeability and width.

In these cases, the long-term productivity of the well may be estimated assuming bilinear flow in the reservoir.

A hydraulic fracturing design should follow the following procedure: 1. Select a fracturing fluid 2. Select a proppant 3. Determine the maximum allowable treatment pressure 4. Select a fracture propagation model 5. Select treatment size (fracture length and proppant concentration) 6. Perform production forecast analyses 7. Perform NPV analysis A complete design must include the following components to direct field operations:.Specifications of fracturing fluid and proppant .Fluid volume and proppant weight requirements .Fluid injection schedule and proppant mixing schedule .Predicted injection pressure profile 17.5.1 Selection of Fracturing Fluid Fracturing fluid plays a vital role in hydraulic fracture treat- ment because it controls the efficiencies of carrying proppant and filling in the fracture pad. Fluid loss is a major fracture design variable characterized by a fluid-loss coefficient CL and a spurt-loss coefficient Sp. Spurt loss occurs only for wall-building fluids and only until the filter cake is estab- lished. Fluid loss into the formation is a more steady process than spurt loss. It occurs after the filter cake is developed. Excessive fluid loss prevents fracture propagation because of insufficient fluid volume accumulation in the fracture. Therefore, a fracture fluid with the lowest possible value of fluid-loss (leak-off) coefficient CLshould be selected. The second major variable is fluid viscosity. It affects transporting, suspending, and deposition of proppants, as well as back-flowing after treatment. The viscosity should be controlled in a range suitable for the treatment. A fluid viscosity being too high can result in excessive injection pressure during the treatment. However, other considerations may also be major for particular cases. They are compatibility with reservoir fluids and rock, compatibility with other materials (e.g., resin-coated proppant), compatibility with operating pressure and temperature, and safety and environmental concerns. 20 180 340 500 660 820 980 1,140 1,300 0 60 140 220 300 380 460 540 620 700 780 860 940 1,020 1,100 1,180 1,260 1,34002,000 Pressure(psi)Distancein the directionperpendicular tothe fracture(ft.)Distance in fracture direction(ft.) Figure 17.8 Relationship between fracture conductivity and equivalent skin factor.17/258 PRODUCTION ENHANCEMENT17.5.2 Selection of Proppant Proppant must be selected on the basis of in situ stress conditions. Major concerns are compressive strength and the effect of stress on proppant permeability. For a vertical fracture, the compressive strength of the proppant should be greater than the effective horizontal stress. In general, bigger proppant yields better permeability, but proppant size must be checked against proppant admittance criteria through the perforations and inside the fracture. Figure 17.9 shows permeabilities of various types of proppants under fracture closure stress. Example Problem 17.3 For the following situation, esti- mate the minimum required compressive strength of 20/ 40 proppant. If intermediate-strength proppant is used, estimate the permeability of the proppant pack: Formation depth: 10,000 ft Overburden density: 165 lb m=ft3 Poison’s ratio: 0.25 Biot constant: 0.7 Reservoir pressure: 6,500 psi Production drawdown: 2,000 and 4,000 psi Solution The initial effective horizontal stress: s0 h¼n 1/C0nrH 144/C0app/C18/C19 ¼0:25 1/C00:25(165)(10,000) 144/C0(0:7)(6500)/C20/C21 ¼2,303 psi The effective horizontal stress under 2,000-psi pressure drawdown: s0 h¼n 1/C0nrH 144/C0app/C18/C19 ¼0:25 1/C00:25(165)(10,000) 144/C0(0:7)(4500)/C20/C21 ¼2,770 psi The effective horizontal stress under 4,000-psi pressure drawdown:s0 h¼n 1/C0nrH 144/C0app/C18/C19 ¼0:25 1/C00:25(165)(10,000) 144/C0(0:7)(2500)/C20/C21 ¼3,236 psi Therefore, the minimum required proppant compressive strength is 3,236 psi. Figure 17.9 indicates that the pack of the intermediate-strength proppants will have a perme- ability of about kf¼500 darcies. 17.5.3 The maximum Treatment Pressure The maximum treatment pressure is expected to occur when the formation is broken down. The bottom-hole pressure is equal to the formation breakdown pressure pbdand the expected surface pressure can be calculated by psi¼pbd/C0DphþDpf, (17 :18) where psi¼surface injection pressure, psia pbd¼formation breakdown pressure, psia Dph¼hydrostatic pressure drop, psia Dpf¼frictional pressure drop, psia. The second and the third term in the right-hand side of Eq. (17.18) can be calculated using Eq. (11.93) (see Chapter 11). However, to avert the procedure of friction factor determination, the following approximation may be used for the frictional pressure drop calculation (Economides and Nolte, 2000): Dpf¼518r0:79q1:79m0:207 1,000 D4:79L, (17 :19) where r¼density of fluid, g =cm3 q¼injection rate, bbl/min m¼fluid viscosity, cp D¼tubing diameter, in.

Generally, the model should be selected to match the level of complexity required for the specific application, quality and quantity of data, allo- cated time to perform a design, and desired level of output. Modeling with a planar 3D model can be time consuming, whereas the results from a 2D model can be simplistic. Pseudo-3D models provide a compromise and are most often used in the industry. However, 2D models are still attractive in situations in which the reservoir conditions are simple and wellunderstood.Forinstance,tosimulate ashortfracture tobe createdinathicksandstone,theKGDmodelmaybebeneficial. To simulate a long fracture to be created in a sandstone tightly bonded by strong overlaying and underlaying shales, the PKN model is more appropriate. To simulate frac-packing in a thick sandstone, the radial fracture model may be adequate. It is always important to consider the availability and quality of inputdatainmodelselection:garbage-ingarbage-out(GIGO). 17.5.5 Selection of Treatment Size Treatment size is primarily de fined by the fracture length. Fluid and proppant volumes are controlled by fracture length, injection rate, and leak-off properties. A general statement can be made that the greater the propped fracture length and greater the proppant volume, the greater the production rate of the fractured well. Limiting effects are imposed by technical and economical factors such as available pumping rate and costs of fluid and proppant. Wi thin these constraints, the optimum scale of treatment should be ideally determined based on the maximum NPV. This section demonstrates how to design treatment size usi ng the KGD fracture model for simplicity. Calculation proce dure is summarized as follows: 1. Assume a fracture half-length xfand injection rate qi, calculate the average fracture width /C22w wusing a selected fracture model. 2.

It is understood that the more refined the design model is, the more optional parameters we have available for pressure matching and the more possible solutions we will get. The importance of capturing the main trend with the simplest model possible can only be beneficial. Attention should be paid to those critical issues in pressure matching such as fracture con- finement. Therefore, all the lumped pseudo-3D models developed for processing speed of pressure-matching ap- plications are widely used. The final result of the net pressure-matching process should ideally be an exact superposition of the simulation on the pumping record. A perfect match is obtainable by adjusting controlling parameter of a fracture simulator,but this operation is quite time consuming and is not the goal of the exercise. Perfect matches are sometimes proposed by manually changing the number of fractures during the propagation. Unfortunately, there is no inde- pendent source that can be used to correlate a variation of the number of fractures. The option of multiple fractures is not available to all simulators. Nevertheless, much pres- sure adjustment can be obtained by changing parameters controlling the near-wellbore effect. Example parameters are the number of perforations, the relative erosion rate of perforation with proppant, and the characteristics of fracture tortuosity. These parameters have a major impact on the bottom-hole response but have nothing to do with the net pressure to be matched for fracture geometry estimate. Matching the Net Pressure during Calibration Treat- ment and the Pad . The calibration treatment match is part of the set of analysis performed on-site for redesign of the injection schedule. This match should be reviewed before proceeding with the analysis of the main treatment itself. Consistency between the parameters obtained from both matches should be maintained and deviation recognized. The first part of the treatment-match process focusing on the pad is identical to a match performed on the cali- bration treatment. The shut-in net pressure obtained from a minifrac (calibration treatment decline) gives the magni- tude of the net pressure. The pad net pressure history (and low prop concentration in the first few stages) is adjusted by changing either the compliance or the tip pressure. The Nolte–Smith Plot (Nolte and Smith, 1981) provides indi- cation of the degree of confinement of the fracture. A positive slope is an indication of confinement, a negative slope an indication of height growth, and a zero slope an indication of toughness-dominated short fracture or mod- erate height growth. Using 2D Models . In general, when the fracture is confined (PKN model) and viscous dominated, we either decrease the height of the zone or increase the Young’s modulus to obtain higher net pressure (compliance is /C24h=E). For a radial fracture (KGD model), we adjust the tip pressure effect to achieve net pressure match. If the fractured formation is a clean sand section and the fracture is confined or with moderate height growth, the fracture height should be fixed to the pay zone. In a layered forma- tion/dirty sandstone, the fracture height could be adjusted because any of the intercalated layers may or may not have been broken down. The fracture could still be confined, but the height cannot a priori be set as easily as in the case of a clean sand zone section. Unconsolidated sands show low Young’s modulus ( /C245/C2105psi), this should not be changed to match the pressure. A low Young modulus value often gives insufficient order of magnitude of net pressure because the viscous force is not the dominating factor. The best way to adjust a fracture elastic model to match the behavior of a loosely consolidated sand is to increase the ‘‘apparent toughness’’ that controls the tip effect propagating pressure. Using Pseudo-3D Models . Height constraint is adjusted by increasing the stress difference between the pay-zone and the bounding layer. Stiffness can be increased with an increase of the Young modulus of all the layers that are fractured or to some extent by adding a small shale layer with high stress in the middle of the zone (pinch-point effect). Very few commercial fracturing simulators actually use a layer description of the modulus. All of the lumped 3D models use an average value. Tip effect can also be adjusted by changing toughness (Meyer et al., 1990). For some simulators, the users have no direct control of this effect, as an apparent toughness is recalculated from the rock toughness and fluid-lag effect.17/262 PRODUCTION ENHANCEMENTSimulating controlled height growth with a pseudo-3D model can be tricky. Height growth is characterized by a slower rate of pressure increase than in the case of a confined fracture. To capture the big picture, a simplifica- tion to a three-layer model can help by reducing the num- ber of possible inputs. Pressure-matching slow height growth of a fracture is tedious and lengthy. In the first phase, we should adjust the magnitude of the simulated net pressure. The match can be considered excellent if the difference between the recorded pressure and the simulated pressure is less than 15% over the length of the pad. The pressure matching can be performed using data from real-time measurements (Wright et al., 1996; Burton et al., 2002). Computer simulation of fracturing operations with recorded job parameters can yield the following frac- ture dimensions: .Fracture height .Fracture half-length .Fracture width A typical pressure matching with a pseudo-3D fracturing model is shown in Fig. 17.12 (Burton et al., 2002). Efficiency and Leakoff . The first estimate of effi- ciency and leakoff is obtained from the calibration treat- ment decline analysis. The calibration treatment provides a direct measurement of the efficiency using the graphical G-plot analysis and the3⁄4rules or by using time to closure with a fracturing simulator. Then calibration with a model that estimates the geometry of the fracture provides the corresponding leakoff coefficient (Meyer and Jacot, 2000). This leakoff coefficient determination is model dependent. Propped Fracture Geometry . Once we have obtained both a reasonable net pressure match, we have an estimate of length and height. We can then directly calculate the average width expressed in mass/area of the propped frac- ture from mass balance. The propped geometry given by any simulator after closure should not be any different.Post-propped Frac Decline . The simulator-generated pressure decline is affected by the model of extension recession that is implemented and by the amount of sur- face area that still have leakoff when the simulator cells are packed with proppant. It is very unlikely that the simula- tor matches any of those extreme cases. The lumped solu- tion used in FracProPT does a good job of matching pressure decline. The analysis methodology was indeed developed around pressure matching the time to closure. The time to closure always relates to the efficiency of the fluid regardless of models (Nolte and Smith, 1981). 17.6.2 Pressure Buildup Test Analysis Fracture and reservoir parameters can be estimated using data from pressure transient well tests (Cinco-Ley and Samaniego, 1981; Lee and Holditch, 1981). In the pressure transient well-test analysis, the log-log plot of pressure derivative versus time is called a diagnostic plot . Special slope values of the derivative curve usually are used for identification of reservoir and boundary models. The transient behavior of a well with a finite-conductivity fracture includes several flow periods. Initially, there is a fracture linear flow characterized by a half-slope straight line; after a transition flow period, the system may or may not exhibit a bilinear flow period, indicated by a one-fourth–slope straight line. As time increases, a for- mation linear flow period might develop. Eventually, the system reaches a pseudo-radial flow period if the drain- age area is significantly larger than the fracture dimension (Fig. 17.13). During the fracture linear flow period, most of the fluid entering the wellbore comes from the expansion of the system within the fracture. The behavior in the period occurs at very small amounts of time, normally a few seconds for the fractures created during frac-packing operations. Thus, the data in this period, even if not distorted by wellbore storage effect, are still not of prac- tical use. 1,5002,0002,5003,0003,5004,000 Treatment Time(min)BHP(psi) −2024681012141618202224262830 Slurry Rate(bbl/min) & Prop Conc(PPA)BHP (Job data)  BHP (PropFRAC)  Slurry Rate (bbl/min) Prop Conc  (PPA) 0 1 01 52 02 53 03 54 0 5 Figure 17.12 Bottom-hole pressure match with three-dimensional fracturing model PropFRAC.HYDRAULIC FRACTURING 17/263The bilinear flow regime means two linear flows occur simultaneously. One flow is a linear flow within the frac- ture and the other is a linear flow in the formation toward the fracture. Bilinear flow analysis gives an estimate of fracture length and conductivity. A calculated pressure distribution during a bilinear flow is illustrated in Fig. 17.2 (Guo and Schechter, 1999). The formation linear flow toward the fracture occurs after the bilinear flow. Linear flow analysis yields an esti- mate of formation permeability in the direction perpen- dicular to the fracture face. If the test time is long enough and there is no boundary effect, a system pseudo-radial flow will eventually occur. Pseudo-radial flow analysis provides an estimate of formation permeability in the radial direction. The reader is referred to Chapter 15 for analysis and interpretation of pressure transient data. It is important to note that by no means does the pressure- match procedure and the pressure transient data analysis give details of the fracture geometry such as fracture width near the wellbore, which frequently dominates the post- treatment well performance. The fracture width near the wellbore can be significantly lower than that in the region away from the wellbore. This can occur because of a number of mishaps. Overdisplacement of proppant leads to the frac- ture unsupported near the wellbore, resulting in fracture closure. Fluid backflow reduces the amount of proppant near the wellbore, which results in less fracture width sup- ported. If the proppant grains do not have compressive strength to withstand the stress concentration in the near- wellboreregion,theywillbecrushedduringfractureclosure, resulting in tight fracture near the wellbore. The reduced fracture width near the wellbore affects well productivity because of the fracture choking effect. Post-treatment flow tests should be run to verify well performance. The effect of near-wellbore fracture geometry on post- treatment well production is of special significance in deviated and horizontal wells (Chen and Economides, 1999). This is because a fracture from an arbitrarily oriented well ‘‘cuts’’ the wellbore at an angle, thereby limiting the communication between the wellbore and the reservoir. This feature of fluid entry to the wellbore itself causes the fracture-choking effect, even though the near- wellbore fracture is perfectly propped. Certainly, a hori- zontal well in the longitudinal to the fracture direction and using 180-degree perforation phasing that can be oriented will eliminate the problem. However, to align the horizon- tal wellbore in the longitudinal to the fracture direction, the horizontal wellbore has to be drilled in the direction parallel to the maximum horizontal stress direction. The orientation of the stress can be obtained by running tests in a vertical pilot hole of the horizontal well. Special log imaging (e.g., FMI and FMS) can be run in combination with an injection test at small-rate MDT or large-scale minifrac to fracture the formation and read directly the image in the wellbore after the fracture has been created.17.6.3 Other evaluation techniques In addition to the pressure-matching and pressure buildup data analyses, other techniques can be used to verify the fracture profile created during a fracpack operation. These techniques include (1) pumping radioactive materials in the proppant stages and running tracer logs to verify the fracture heights, (2) running production logging tools to determine the production profiles, and (3) conducting back-pressure and performing Nodal analysis to verify the well deliverability.

A rigorous definition of the term has not been found from the literature. The book by Beggs (2003) ‘‘Production Optimization Using NODAL Analysis’’ presents a systems analysis approach (called NODAL analysis, or Nodal analysis) to analyze performance of production systems. Although the entire production system is analyzed as a total unit, interacting components, electrical circuits, complex pipeline networks, pumps, and compressors are evaluated individually using this method. Locations of excessive flow resistance or pressure drop in any part of the network are identified. To the best of our understanding, production optimiza- tion means determination and implementation of the optimum values of parameters in the production system to maximize hydrocarbon production rate (or discounted revenue) or to minimize operating cost under various tech- nical and economical constraints. Because a system can be defined differently, the production optimization can be performed at different levels such as well level, platform/ facility level, and field level. This chapter describes production optimization of systems defined as .Naturally flowing well .Gas-lifted well .Sucker rod–pumped well .Separator .Pipeline network .Gas lift facility .Oil and gas production fields In the upstream oil and gas production, various appro- aches and technologies are used to address different as- pects of hydrocarbon production optimization. They serve to address various business objectives. For example, on- line facility optimizer addresses the problem of maximizing the value of feedstock throughput in real time. This chap- ter presents principals of production optimization with the aids of computer programs when necessary. 18.2 Naturally Flowing Well A naturally flowing well may be the simplest system in production optimization. The production rate from a sin- gle flowing well is dominated by inflow performance, tub- ing size, and wellhead pressure controlled by choke size. Because the wellhead pressure is usually constrained by surface facility requirements, there is normally not much room to play with the choke size. Well inflow performance is usually improved with well-stimulation techniques including matrix acidizing and hydraulic fracturing. While matrix-acidizing treat- ment is effective for high-permeability reservoirs with significant well skins, hydraulic-fracturing treatment is more beneficial for low-permeability reservoirs. Inflow equations derived from radial flow can be used for pre- dicting inflow performance of acidized wells, and equa- tions derived from both linear flow and radial flow may be employed for forecasting deliverability of hydraulically fractured wells. These equations are found in Chapter 15. Figure 18.1 illustrates inflow performance relationship (IPR) curves for a well before and after stimulation. It shows that the benefit of the stimulation reduces as bottom-hole pressure increases. Therefore, after predicting inflow performance of the stimulated well, single-well Nodal analysis needs to be carried out. The operating points of stimulated well and nonstimulated wells are compared. This comparison provides an indication ofwhether the well inflow is the limiting step that controls well deliverability. If yes, treatment design may proceed (Chapters 16 and 17) and economic evaluation should be performed (see Section 18.9). If no, optimization of tubing size should be investigated. It is not true that the larger the tubing size is, the higher the well deliverability is. This is because large tubing reduces the gas-lift effect in oil wells. Large tubing also results in liquid loading of gas wells due to the inadequate kinetic energy of gas flow required to lift liquid. The optimal tubing size yields the lowest frictional pressure drop and the maximum production rate. Nodal analysis can be used to generate tubing performance curve (plot of operating rate vs tubing size) from which the optimum tubing size can be identified. Figure 18.2 shows a typical tubing performance curve. It indicates that a 3.5-in. inner diameter (ID) tubing will give a maximum oil production rate of 600 stb/day. However, this tubing size may not be considered optimal because a 3.0-in. ID tubing will also deliver a similar oil production rate and this tubing may be cheaper to run. An economics evaluation should be performed (see Section 18.9). 18.3 Gas-Lifted Well The optimization of individual gas-lift wells mainly focuses on determining and using the optimal gas-lift gas injection rate. Overinjection of gas-lift gas is costly and results in lower oil production rate.

Figure 18.3 presents a typical gas-lift performance curve. It shows that a 5.0-MMscf/day gas injection rate will give a maximum oil production rate of 260 stb/day. However, this gas injection rate may not be the optimum rate because slightly lower gas injection rates will also deliver a similar oil production rate with lower high-pressure gas con- sumption. An economics evaluation should be performed on a scale of a batch of similar wells (see Section 18.9). 18.4 Sucker Rod–Pumped Well The potential of increasing oil production rate of a normal sucker rod–pumped well is usually low. Optimization of this type of well mainly focuses on two areas: .Improving the volumetric efficiency of the plunger pump .Improving the energy efficiency of the pumping unit Estimating the volumetric efficiency of plunger pump and improving the energy efficiency of the pumping unit require the use of the information from a dynamometer card that records polished rod load. Figure 18.4 demon- strates a theoretical load cycle for elastic sucker rods. However, because of the effects of acceleration and fric- tion, the actual load cycles are very different from the theoretical cycles. Figure 18.5 demonstrates an actual load cycle of a sucker rod under normal working condi- tions. It illustrates that the peak polished rod load can be significantly higher than the theoretical maximum pol- ished rod load. Much information can be obtained from the dynamom- eter card. The procedure is illustrated with the parameters shown in Fig. 18.6. The nomenclature is as follows: C¼calibration constant of the dynamometer, lb/in. D1¼maximum deflection, in. D2¼minimum deflection, in. D3¼load at the counterbalance line (CB) drawn on the dynamometer card by stopping the pumping unit at the position of maximum counterbalance effect (crank arm is horizontal on the upstroke), in.

In addition to the dimensional parameter values taken from the dynamometer card, the shape of the card can be used for identifying the working condition of the plunger pump. The shape of the dynamometer cards are influenced by .Speed and pumping depth .Pumping unit geometry .Pump condition .Fluid condition .Friction factor Brown (1980) listed 13 abnormal conditions that can be identified from the shape of the dynamometer cards. Forexample, the dynamometer card shown in Fig. 18.7 indicates synchronous pumping speeds, and the dynamometer card depicted in Fig. 18.8 reveals a gas-lock problem. 18.5 Separator Optimization of the separation process mainly focuses on recovering more oil by adjusting separator temperature and pressure. Field experience proves that lowering the operating temperature of a separator increases the liquid recovery. It is also an efficient means of handling high- pressure gas and condensate at the wellhead. A low-tem- perature separation unit consists of a high-pressure separa- tor, pressure-reducing chokes, and various pieces of heat exchange equipment. When the pressure is reduced by the use of a choke, the fluid temperature decreases because of the Joule–Thomson or the throttling effect. This is an irreversible adiabatic process whereby the heat content of the gas remains the same across the choke but the pressure and temperature of the gas stream are reduced. Generally at least 2,500–3,000 psi pressure drop is required from wellhead flowing pressure to pipeline pres- sure for a low-temperature separation unit to pay out in increased liquid recovery. The lower the operating tem- perature of the separator, the lighter the liquid recovered will be. The lowest operating temperature recommended for low-temperature units is usually around /C020/C14F. This is constrained by carbon steel embitterment, and high-alloy steels for lower temperatures are usually not economical for field installations. Low-temperature separation units are normally operated in the range of 0–20 8F. The actual temperature drop per unit pressure drop is affected by several factors including composition of gas stream, gas and liquid flow rates, bath temperature, and ambient tem- perature. Temperature reduction in the process can be estimated using the equations presented in Chapter 5.LZero lineD3C.B. A2 A1D1 D2 Figure 18.6 Dimensional parameters of a dynamometer card.

Liquid and vapor phase densities can be predicted by flash calculation. Following the special requirement for construction of low-temperature separation units, the pressure-reducing choke is usually mounted directly on the inlet of the high-pressure separator. Hydrates form in the downstream of the choke because of the low gas temperature and fall to the bottom settling section of the separator. They are heated and melted by liquid heating coils located in the bottom of the separator. Optimization of separation pressure is performed with flash calculations. Based on the composition of well- stream fluid, the quality of products from each stage of separation can be predicted, assuming phase equilibriums are reached in the separators. This requires the knowledge of the equilibrium ratio defined as ki¼yi xi, (18:1) where ki¼liquid/vapor equilibrium ratio of compound i yi¼mole fraction of compound iin the vapor phase xi¼mole fraction of compound iin the liquid phase. Accurate determination of kivalues requires computer simulators solving the Equation of State (EoS) for hydro- carbon systems. Ahmed (1989) presented a detailed procedure for solving the EoS. For pressures lower than 1,000 psia, a set of equations presented by Standing (1979) provide an easy and accurate means of determining ki values. According to Standing, kican be calculated by ki¼1 p10aþcFi, (18:2) where a¼1:2þ4:5/C210/C04pþ1:5/C210/C09p2(18:3) c¼0:89/C01:7/C210/C04p/C03:5/C210/C08p2(18:4) Fi¼bi1 Tbi/C01 T/C18/C19 (18:5) bi¼logpci 14:7/C16/C17 1 Tbi/C01 Tci, (18 :6) where pc¼critical pressure, psia Tb¼boiling point, 8R Tc¼critical temperature, 8R.

Then, xiand yican be calculated with Eqs. (18.10) and (18.13), respectively.

For gas condensates, there exists an optimum separation pressure that yields the lower GOR at a given temperature.

The results are shown in Table 18.1. 18.6 Pipeline Network Optimization of pipelines mainly focuses on de-bottle- necking of the pipeline network, that is, finding the most restrictive pipeline segments and replacing/adding larger segments to remove the restriction effect. This requires the knowledge of flow of fluids in the pipe. This section pre- sents mathematical models for gas pipelines. The same principle applies to oil flow.

This figure indicates an interesting behavior of looping: The increase in gas capacity is not directly proportional to the fraction of looped pipeline. For example, looping of 40% of pipe with a new pipe of the same diameter will increase only 20% of the gas flow capacity. It also shows that the benefit of looping increases with the fraction of looping. For example, looping of 80% of the pipe with a new pipe of the same diameter will increase 60%, not 40%, of gas flow capacity. Example Problem 18.3 Consider a 4-in. pipeline that is 10 miles long. Assuming that the compression and delivery pressures will maintain unchanged, calculate gas capacity increases by using the following measures of improvement: (a) replace 3 miles of the 4-in. pipeline by a 6-in. pipeline segment; (b) place a 6-in. parallel pipeline to share gasTable 18.1 Flash Calculation with Standing’s Method for kiValues Flash calculation nv¼0:8791 Compound z i ki zi(ki/C01)=[nv(ki/C01)þ1] C1 0.6599 6.5255 0.6225 C2 0.0869 1.8938 0.0435 C3 0.0591 0.8552 /C00:0098 i-C4 0.0239 0.4495 /C00:0255 n-C 4 0.0278 0.3656 /C00:0399 i-C5 0.0157 0.1986 /C00:0426 n-C 5 0.0112 0.1703 /C00:0343 C6 0.0181 0.0904 /C00:0822 C7þ 0.0601 0.0089 /C00:4626 N2 0.0194 30.4563 0.0212 CO 2 0.0121 3.4070 0.0093 H2S 0.0058 1.0446 0.0002 Sum: 0.0000 nL¼0.1209 Compound x i yi xiMW i yiMW i C1 0.1127 0.7352 1.8071 11.7920 C2 0.0487 0.0922 1.4633 2.7712 C3 0.0677 0.0579 2.9865 2.5540 i-C4 0.0463 0.0208 2.6918 1.2099 n-C 4 0.0629 0.0230 3.6530 1.3356 i-C5 0.0531 0.0106 3.8330 0.7614 n-C 5 0.0414 0.0070 2.9863 0.5085 C6 0.0903 0.0082 7.7857 0.7036 C7þ 0.4668 0.0042 53.3193 0.4766 N2 0.0007 0.0220 0.0202 0.6156 CO 2 0.0039 0.0132 0.1709 0.5823 H2S 0.0056 0.0058 0.1902 0.1987 Apparent molecular weight of liquid phase:23.51 80.91 Apparent molecular weight of vapor phase:0.76 Specific gravity of liquid phase:water ¼1 Specific gravity of vapor phase:0.81 air ¼1 Input vapor phase zfactor:0.958 Density of liquid phase: 47.19 lb m=ft3 Density of vapor phase: 2.08 lb m=ft3 Volume of liquid phase: 0.04 bbl Volume of vapor phase: 319.66 scf GOR: 8,659 scf/bbl API gravity of liquid phase:5618/274 PRODUCTION ENHANCEMENTtransmission; and (c) loop 3 miles of the 4-in. pipeline with a 6-in. pipeline segment.

Table 18.2 shows the solution to Example Problem 18.3 given by the spreadsheet. 18.7 Gas-Lift Facility Optimization of gas lift at the facility level mainly focuses on determination of the optimum lift-gas distribution among the gas-lifted wells. If lift-gas volume is not limited by the capacity of the compression station, every well should get the lift-gas injection rate being equal to its optimal gas injection rate (see Section 18.3). If limited lift-gas volume is available from the compression station, the lift gas should be assigned first to those wells that will produce more incrementals of oil production for a given incremental of lift-gas injection rate. This can be done by calculating and comparing the slopes of the gas-lift performance curves of individual wells at the points of adding more lift-gas injection rate. This principle can be illustrated by the following example problem. Example Problem 18.4 The gas-lift performance curves of two oil wells are known based on Nodal analyses at well level. The performance curve of Well A is presented in Fig. 18.3 and that of Well B is in Fig. 18.12. If a total lift-gas injection rate of 1.2 to 6.0 MMscf/day is available to the two wells, what lift-gas flow rates should be assigned to each well? Solution Data used for plotting the two gas-lift performance curves are shown in Table 18.3. Numerical derivatives (slope of the curves) are also included. At each level of given total gas injection rate, the incre- mental gas injection rate (0.6 MMscf/day) is assigned to one of the wells on the basis of their performance curve slope at the present gas injection rate of the well. The procedure and results are summarized in Table 18.4. The results indicate that the share of total gas injection rate by wells depends on the total gas rate availability and per- formance of individual wells. If only 2.4 MMscf/day of gas is available, no gas should be assigned to Well A. If only 3.6 MMscf/day of gas is available, Well A should share one-third of the total gas rate. If only 6.0 MMscf/day of gas is available, each well should share 50% of the total gas rate.020406080100120140160180200 Looped Line (%)Increase in Flow Rate (%)RD = 0.4 RD = 0.6 RD = 0.8 RD = 1.0 RD = 1.2 RD = 1.4 RD = 1.6 RD = 1.8 RD = 2.0 100 0 1 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0 Figure 18.11 Effects of looped line and pipe diameter ratio on the increase of gas flow rate.PRODUCTION OPTIMIZATION 18/27518.8 Oil and Gas Production Fields An oil or gas field integrates wells, flowlines, separation facilities, pump stations, compressor stations, and trans- portation pipelines as a whole system. Single-phase and multiphase flow may exist in different portions in the system. Depending on system complexity and the objective of optimization task, field level production optimization can be performed using different approaches. 18.8.1 Types of Flow Networks Field-level production optimization deals with complex flow systems of two types: (1) hierarchical networks and (2) nonhierarchical networks. A hierarchical network is defined as a treelike converging system with multiple in- flow points (sources) and one outlet (sink). Figure 18.13 illustrates two hierarchical networks. Flow directions in this type of network are known. Fluid flow in this type of network can be simulated using sequential solving approach. Commercial software to perform this type of computation are those system analysis (Nodal analysis) programs such as FieldFlo and PipeSim, among others. A nonhierarchical network is defined as a general system with multiple inflow points (sources) and multiple outlets (sinks). Loops may exist, so the flow directions in some portions of the network are not certain. Figure 18.14 presents a nonhierarchical network. Arrows in this figure represent flow directions determined by a computer pro- gram. Fluid flow in this type of network can be simulatedusing simultaneous solving approaches. Commercial soft- ware to perform this type of computations include ReO, GAP, HYSYS, FAST Piper, and others. 18.8.2 Optimization Approaches Field-level production optimizations are carried out with two distinct approaches: (a) the simulation approach and (b) the optimization approach. 18.8.2.1 Simulation Approach The simulation approach is a kind of trial-and-error approach. A computer program simulates flow conditions (pressures and flow rates) with fixed values of variables in each run. All parameter values are input manually before each run. Different scenarios are investigated with differ- ent sets of input data. Optimal solution to a given problem is selected on the basis of results of many simulation runs with various parameter values. Thus, this approach is more time consuming. 18.8.2.2 Optimization Approach The optimization approach is a kind of intelligence-based approach. It allows some values of parameters to be determined by the computer program in one run. The parameter values are optimized to ensure the objective function is either maximized (production rate as the objective function) or minimized (cost as the objective function) under given technical or economical constraints. Apparently, the optimization approach is more efficient than the simulation approach. 18.8.3 Procedure for Production Optimization The following procedure may be followed in production optimization: 1. Define the main objective of the optimization study. The objectives can be maximizing the total oil/gas production rate or minimizing the total cost of operation. 2. Define the scope (boundary) of the flow network. 3. Based on the characteristics of the network and fluid type, select a computer program. 4. Gather the values of component/equipment param- eters in the network such as well-inflow performance, tubing sizes, choke sizes, flowline sizes, pump capacity, compressor horsepower, and others. 5. Gather fluid information including fluid compositions and properties at various points in the network. 6. Gather the fluid-flow information that reflects the cur- rent operating point, including pressures, flow rates, and temperatures at all the points with measurements.Operating Rate (stb/day)2,000 1,500 1,200 800 400 0 Life Gas Injection Rate (MMscf/day)0 1.5 3 4.5 6 Figure 18.12 A typical gas lift performance curve of a high-productivity well.

Field-level optimiza- tion can be performed with ReO, GAP, HYSYS, FAST Piper, among others. This section makes a brief introduc- tion to these packages. 18.8.4.1 ReO The software ReO (EPS, 2004) is a compositional produc- tion simulator that can simulate and optimize highly non- hierarchical networks of multiphase flow. Its optimizer technology is based on sequential linear programming techniques. Because the network is solved simultaneously rather than sequentially, as is the case for nodal analysis techniques, the system can optimize and simulate account- ing for targets, objectives, and constraints anywhere in the network.A key feature of ReO is that it is both a production simulation and an optimization tool. Simulation deter- mines the pressures, temperatures, and fluid flow rates within the production system, whereas optimization deter- mines the most economical production strategy subject to engineering or economic constraints. The economic mod- eling capability inherent within ReO takes account of the revenues from hydrocarbon sales in conjunction with the production costs, to optimize the net revenue from the field. The ReO Simulation option generates distributions of pressure, temperature, and flow rates of water, oil, and gas in a well-defined network. The ReO Optimization option determines optimum parameter values that will lead to the maximum hydrocarbon production rate or the minimum operating cost under given technical and economical constraints. ReO addresses the need to opti- mize production operations, that is, between reservoir and facilities, in three main areas: .To aid in the design of new production capacity, both conceptual and in detail .To optimize production systems either off-line or in real time .To forecast performance and create production profiles for alternative development scenarios ReO integrates complex engineering calculations, practical constraints, and economic parameters to determine the optimal configuration of production network. It can be employed in all phases of field life, from planning through development and operations, and to enable petroleum, production, facility, and other engineers to share the same integrated model of the field and perform critical analysis and design activities such as the following: .Conceptual design in new developmentsTable 18.3 Gas Lift Performance Data for Well A and Well B Oil production rate (stb/day) Slope of performance curve (stb/MMscf) Lift gas injection rate (MMscf/day) Well A Well B Well A Well B 0.6 0 740 242 850 1.2 145 1,250 150 775 1.8 180 1,670 54 483 2.4 210 1,830 46 142 3 235 1,840 33 13 3.6 250 1,845 17 6 4.2 255 1,847 8 0 4.8 259 1,845 4 /C056 5.4 260 1,780 /C03 /C0146 6 255 1,670 Table 18.4 Assignments of Different Available Lift Gas Injection Rates to Well A and Well B Total lift gasGas injection rate before assignment (stb/day)Slope of performance curve (stb/MMscf)Lift gas assignment (MMscf/day)Gas injection rate after assignment (stb/day) (MMscf/day) Well A Well B Well A Well B Well A Well B Well A Well B 1.2 0 0 242 850 0 1.2 0 1.2 1.8 0 1.2 242 775 0 0.6 0 1.8 2.4 0 1.8 242 483 0 0.6 0 2.4 3 0 2.4 242 142 0.6 0 0.6 2.4 3.6 0.6 2.4 242 142 0.6 0 1.2 2.4 4.2 1.2 2.4 150 142 0.6 0 1.8 2.4 4.8 1.8 2.4 54 142 0 0.6 1.8 3 5.4 1.8 3 54 13 0.6 0 2.4 3 6 2.4 3 46 13 0.6 0 3 318/278 PRODUCTION ENHANCEMENT.Equipment sizing, evaluation and selection .Daily production optimization, on-line or off-line .Problem and bottleneck detection/diagnosis .Production forecasting .Reservoir management .Data management Target and penalty functions are used in ReO within a valid region. This type of ‘‘target’’ is required to find the best compromise among conflicting objectives in a system. An example might be ensuring maximum production by driving down wellhead pressure in a gas field while main- taining optimum intake pressures to a compressor train. One of the most important aspects of modeling produc- tion systems is the correct calculation of fluid PVT prop- erties. Variable detail and quality often characterizes the PVT data available to the engineer, and ReO is designed to accommodate this. If complete compositional analysis has been performed, this can be used directly. If only Black Oil data are available, ReO will use a splitting technique to define a set of components to use in the compositional description. This approach means that dif- ferent fluids, with different levels of detailed description can be combined into the same base set of components. Where wells are producing fluids of different composition, the mixing of these fluids is accurately modeled in the system. The composition is reported at all the nodes in the network. This is highly valuable in fields with differing wells compositions. The facility models available in ReO for gas networks include pipeline, chokes (both variable and fixed diam- eter), block valves, standard compressors (polytropic model), heat exchangers (intercoolers), gas and gas con- densate wells, sinks (separators, gas export and delivery points, flares, or vents), manifolds, links (no pressure loss pipelines), and flanges (no flow constraint). Production constraints may be defined at any point within the production system in terms of pressure and/or flow rate along with objective functions for maximizing and minimizing flow rate or pressure in terms of sales revenues and costs. ReO is seamlessly integrated with the program WellFlo application. WellFlo may be run from within ReO and new well models may be defined or existing well models used to simulate inflow and tubing performance. The most complex application of ReO has been in Latin America where a network system including several hundred wells is optimized on a daily basis through a SCADA system. This system includes a low-pressure gas-gathering network integrated with a number of compressor trains and a high-pressure gas injection and distribution network. 18.8.4.2 HYSYS HYSYS is an integrated steady-state and dynamic process simulator (AspenTech, 2005). HYSYS creates simulation models for the following: .Plant design .Performance monitoring .Troubleshooting .Operational improvement .Business planning .Asset management HYSYS offers an integrated set of intuitive and interactive simulation and analysis tools and real-time applications. It provides rapid evaluations of safe and reliable designs through quick creation of interactive models for ‘‘what if’’ studies and sensitivity analysis. HYSYS Upstream is for handling petroleum fluids and RefSYS is for handling multiunit modeling and simulation of refinery systems. HYSYS interfaces with applicationssuch as Microsoft Excel and Visual Basic and features ActiveX compliance. 18.8.4.3 FAST Piper FAST Piper (Fekete, 2001) is a gas pipeline, wellbore, and reservoir deliverability model that enables the user to op- timize both existing and proposed gas-gathering systems. FAST Piper is designed to be a ‘‘quick and simple looking tool’’ that can solve very complicated gathering system designs and operating scenarios. Developed and supported under Microsoft Windows 2000 and Windows XP, FAST Piper deals with critical issues such as multiphase flow, compressors, contracts, rate limitations, multiple wells, multiple pools, gas com- position tracking, among others. The Key Features FAST Piper include the following: .Allows matching of current production conditions .Analyzes ‘‘what-if’’ scenarios (additional wells, com- pression, contracts, etc.) .Integrated the coal bed methane (CBM) reservoir model allowing the user to predict the total gas and water production of an interconnected network of CBM wells, while incorporating compressor capacity curves, facility losses, and pipeline friction losses. 18.9 Discounted Revenue The economics of production optimization projects is evaluated on the basis of discounted revenue to be gener- ated by the projects. The most widely used method for calculating the discounted revenue is to predict the net present value (NPV) defined as NPV ¼NPV R/C0cost, (18 :47) where NPV R¼Xm n¼1DRn 1þiðÞn, (18 :48) where mis the remaining life of the system in years, and iis the discount rate. The annual incremental revenue after optimization is expressed as DRn¼$ðÞDNp,n, (18 :49) where ($) is oil or gas price and the DNp,nis the predicted annual incremental cumulative production for year n, which is expressed as DNp,n¼Nop p,n/C0Nno p,n, (18 :50) where Nop p,n¼forcasted annual cumulative production of optimized system for year n Nno p,n¼predicted annual cumulative production of non-optimized well for year n. Summary This chapter presents principles of production optimization of well, facility, and field levels. While well- and facility- level optimization computations can be carried out using Nodal analysis approach, field-level computations fre- quently require simulators with simultaneous solvers. Pro- duction optimization is driven by production economics. References ahmed, t. Hydrocarbon Phase Behavior . Houston: Gulf Publishing Company, 1989. AspenTech. Aspen HYSYS.

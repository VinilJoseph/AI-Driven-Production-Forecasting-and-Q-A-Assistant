# ProdForecast-QAChatbot

üóíÔ∏è **ProdForecast-QAChatbot** 

This is a Production Forecasting and QA Chatbot project that combines advanced time series forecasting with interactive question-answering capabilities. The application is designed to predict oil production rates and provide insights through a chatbot interface.

## üöÄ Features

- **Production Forecasting:** 
  - Utilizes multiple forecasting models including Neural Networks, LSTM, Prophet, and RNN.
  - Allows users to select a time period and visualize predictions from different models on a single graph.
  - Capable of handling time series data specific to oil production.

- **QA Chatbot:**
  - Interactive chatbot designed to answer queries related to the forecasting process, models, and predictions.
  - Provides detailed explanations and insights into the production data and forecast results.
  - Built with a focus on user experience and complete responses.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries/Frameworks:**
  - `Streamlit` for building the web interface
  - `TensorFlow` and `Keras` for Neural Networks and LSTM
  - `Facebook Prophet` for time series forecasting
  - `Django` for backend integration (if applicable)
  - `LangChain` for QA chatbot implementation
- **Tools:**
  - `Git` for version control
  - `Conda` for environment management

## üìä Forecasting Models

The project includes the following forecasting models:
- **Neural Network**: A simple feedforward neural network for basic forecasting.
- **LSTM**: A Long Short-Term Memory model for handling time series data.
- **Prophet**: A forecasting model designed for time series data with daily observations.
- **RNN**: A Recurrent Neural Network model for capturing temporal dependencies.

## üó®Ô∏è Chatbot Capabilities

The chatbot is capable of:
- Answering user questions related to oil production data.
- Providing insights and explanations for forecasts.
- Guiding users through the process of using the forecasting models.
